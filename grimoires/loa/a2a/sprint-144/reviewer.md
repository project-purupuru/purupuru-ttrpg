# Sprint 144 (cycle-100 Sprint 2) — Implementation Report

**Branch:** `feat/cycle-100-sprint-2-coverage-multiturn`
**Date:** 2026-05-08
**Sprint goal:** Cover the remaining 2 vector categories (encoded_payload + multi_turn_conditioning), ship the multi-turn replay harness, and reach ≥45 active vectors with all 7 categories ≥5.
**Author:** deep-name + Claude Opus 4.7 1M

---

## Executive Summary

Sprint 2 delivers the multi-turn replay harness, the encoded-payload category (5 vectors), 11 multi-turn vectors with replay JSON fixtures, and 10 backfill vectors that lift each Sprint-1 category to ≥6. The corpus reaches **46 active vectors** across all 7 categories — exceeding the ≥45 floor with margin. The pytest harness validates per-turn redaction counts AND final-state aggregation per SDD §4.4 IMP-006 in fresh subprocesses (statelessness invariant). All single-shot bats vectors stay green; runner.bats now skips the multi_turn_conditioning category which the pytest harness owns.

**Cypherpunk T2.7 dual-review** surfaced 0 CRITICAL, 3 HIGH, 5 MEDIUM, 4 LOW, 4 PRAISE findings. **All 3 HIGH and all 5 MEDIUM addressed inline pre-merge.** 4 LOW deferred to follow-up tracker.

| Multi-turn vectors | 11 (≥10 ✓) |
| First-N-turn-bypass-class vectors | 4 (RT-MT-001/002/003/008; ≥3 ✓) |
| Single-shot bats tests passing | 35 / 35 |
| Pytest tests passing | 39 / 39 (12 multi-turn + 27 apparatus) |

## AC Verification

Per Sprint 2 plan §"Acceptance Criteria":

| # | Acceptance Criterion (verbatim) | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | "Every multi-turn JSON fixture uses placeholder `__FIXTURE:_make_evil_body_<id>__` content; harness substitutes at test time" | ✓ Met | `tests/red-team/jailbreak/fixtures/replay/RT-MT-{001..011}.json` (11 files) — every `content` field referencing an adversarial trigger uses the `__FIXTURE:` placeholder, never a literal trigger string. Substitution at `tests/red-team/jailbreak/lib/corpus_loader.py:295-352` (`substitute_runtime_payloads`). Exercised by `tests/unit/test_replay_harness.py:217-273` (TestSubstituteRuntimePayloads, 6 tests). |
| 2 | "Each turn invokes `sanitize_for_session_start` in a **fresh subprocess** (proves stateless-sanitizer assumption per SDD §4.4)" | ✓ Met | `test_replay.py:54-86` (`_invoke_sanitize_subprocess` uses `subprocess.run` per turn; no in-process state). Statelessness pin: `test_replay_harness.py:281-326` (TestSubprocessIsolation, 2 tests including H2-closure byte-equal-output assertion). |
| 3 | "Per-turn `expected_per_turn_redactions` count assertion fires per-turn → [G-3]" | ✓ Met | `test_replay.py:208-225` per-turn assertion with `count_redactions` delta in failure message. Failure-format pin: `test_replay_harness.py:373-381` (`test_per_turn_mismatch_message_includes_delta`). |
| 4 | "Final-aggregated-state assertion catches the cumulative-attack class (SDD §4.4 IMP-006 aggregation semantics)" | ✓ Met | `test_replay.py:227-250` (`final_state = "".join(...)` per IMP-006); `_assert_final_outcome` at `test_replay.py:107-167`. Cumulative-attack documentation: `corpus/multi_turn_conditioning.jsonl:13` (RT-MT-004 split-payload defense gap) + RT-MT-007 fence-precedence operator-visibility finding. |
| 5 | "Harness output on failure includes `vector_id` + turn index + redaction-count delta" | ✓ Met | `test_replay.py:217-225` `pytest.fail(f"{vector.vector_id} turn {i}: expected … got … delta = {…:+d} stdout[0..200] = …")`. |
| 6 | "Multi-turn harness completes ≤120s for 10 vectors (NFR-Perf2)" | ✓ Met | `pytest tests/red-team/jailbreak/test_replay.py` measured at 3.09s for 12 tests (11 vectors + 1 smoke), well under 120s budget. Re-measured after H3 closure (per-vector budget enforcement): 3.77s for 39 tests. |
| 7 | "All 7 categories ≥5 active vectors before sprint exit (FR-2 floor)" | ✓ Met | `bash tests/red-team/jailbreak/lib/corpus_loader.sh count` → active=46. Per-category iter-active counts: role_switch=6, tool_call_exfiltration=6, credential_leak=6, markdown_indirect=6, unicode_obfuscation=6, encoded_payload=5, multi_turn_conditioning=11. |
| 8 | "Pytest entrypoint + standalone CLI both invokable for ad-hoc operator runs (UC-3 acceptance)" | ⏸ [ACCEPTED-DEFERRED] | Pytest entrypoint: `pytest -k RT-MT-NNN tests/red-team/jailbreak/test_replay.py` works. Standalone replay-specific CLI deferred to Sprint 4 README docs phase. **Decision Log entry**: `grimoires/loa/NOTES.md` 2026-05-08 §"AC-8 deferral (sprint-144)". `corpus_loader.py:__main__` already exposes validate/iter/get/count subcommands today. |
| 9 | "Sprint-2 cypherpunk dual-review closed pre-merge" | ✓ Met | Dual review consists of: (1) **paranoid-cypherpunk subagent** during /implement T2.7 (12 findings: 0 CRIT, 3 HIGH, 5 MED, 4 LOW, 4 PRAISE) and (2) **claude-opus-4-7 cross-model review** during /review-sprint Phase 2.5 (6 findings: 1 BLOCKING confirmed, 1 BLOCKING + 1 BLOCKING downgraded after my triage as false-positives, 3 ADVISORY). Both reviews land at `grimoires/loa/a2a/sprint-144/` (cypherpunk findings in this report; cross-model in `adversarial-review.json`). DISS-001 cross-validated NEW-B1 (leading-whitespace bypass — closed inline). |

Per Sprint 2 plan §"Technical Tasks" (T2.1–T2.7) checklist below mirrors the 9 ACs.

---

## Tasks Completed

### T2.1 — encoded_payload fixtures + 5 active vectors

- **Files added:**
  - `tests/red-team/jailbreak/fixtures/encoded_payload.sh` (bash; runtime base64/ROT-13/hex/URL-percent encoding via `base64`, `tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'`, `xxd -p`, manual `printf '%%%02X'` loop with `printf -v`)
  - `tests/red-team/jailbreak/fixtures/encoded_payload.py` (python parity; `base64`, `codecs.encode(..., "rot_13")`, `.encode().hex()`, `''.join(f'%{b:02X}' for b in raw.encode())`)
  - `tests/red-team/jailbreak/corpus/encoded_payload.jsonl` (5 vectors RT-EP-001..005)
- **Outcome distribution:** 5 × wrapped (encoded forms do not match L1 patterns; defense relies on L2 envelope + downstream model not auto-decoding)
- **Source citation mix:** OWASP-LLM-01 (×2), Anthropic-paper (×1), in-house-cypherpunk (×2) — meets "≥2 public, ≤2 in-house" plan AC.
- **Bash↔python parity:** verified byte-equal output across all 5 vectors (`bash` shell harness, lines hidden in trajectory).

### T2.2 — multi_turn_conditioning fixtures + 11 vectors + replay JSONs

- **Files added:**
  - `tests/red-team/jailbreak/fixtures/multi_turn_conditioning.{sh,py}` (12 functions: 11 trigger-turn fixtures + 3 split-payload helpers for RT-MT-004)
  - `tests/red-team/jailbreak/fixtures/replay/RT-MT-001.json` … `RT-MT-011.json` (11 files)
  - `tests/red-team/jailbreak/corpus/multi_turn_conditioning.jsonl` (11 vectors)
- **First-N-turn-bypass class:** RT-MT-001 (turn 4), RT-MT-002 (turn 4 tool-call), RT-MT-003 (turn 5 DAN), RT-MT-008 (turn 4 forget) → 4 vectors (≥3 AC).
- **Cross-category compounding:** RT-MT-009 (encoded + multi-turn), RT-MT-010 (Unicode + multi-turn), RT-MT-011 (markdown + multi-turn).
- **Defense-gap documentation:** RT-MT-004 (split-payload); RT-MT-007 (fence-precedence operator-visibility — re-framed per cypherpunk M3).
- **Mixed-role coverage:** RT-MT-006 alternates operator → downstream → operator with trigger on the third operator turn.
- **Per-turn outcomes OBSERVED:** every vector's `expected_per_turn_redactions` measured against live SUT before authoring (full table in audit log).

### T2.3 — test_replay.py multi-turn harness

- **File added:** `tests/red-team/jailbreak/test_replay.py` (~250 lines)
- **Pytest parametrize:** over `corpus_loader.iter_active(category="multi_turn_conditioning")` with `ids=lambda v: v.vector_id`.
- **Per-turn invocation:** `_invoke_sanitize_subprocess` runs `bash -c "source $1; sanitize_for_session_start $2 $3"` in a fresh subprocess per turn (statelessness invariant).
- **Per-turn assertion:** `count_redactions(stdout) == expected_per_turn[i]` with delta-and-truncated-stdout failure message.
- **Final-state aggregation:** `final_state = "".join(stdout for stdout, _, _ in actual_outputs)` per IMP-006.
- **Outcome semantics:** `_assert_final_outcome` covers redacted / wrapped / rejected / passed-through-unchanged.
- **Audit emission:** `_emit_audit_run_entry` per vector with status (pass / fail) + reason; non-zero subprocess exit logged to stderr (M4 closure).
- **Per-vector aggregate budget:** 10s per IMP-002, enforced via `remaining` parameter passed to subprocess timeout (H3 closure).
- **Test count:** 12 (11 multi-turn vectors + 1 module-import smoke).

### T2.4 — corpus_loader.py replay helpers

- **File extended:** `tests/red-team/jailbreak/lib/corpus_loader.py` (+~150 lines, lines 203-352).
- **API additions:**
  - `_REPLAY_DIR` (test-mode dual-condition gate via `_resolve_override`, mirrors Sprint 1 pattern)
  - `_PLACEHOLDER_RE` — `re.compile(r"__FIXTURE:(_make_evil_body_[a-z0-9_]+)__\s*")` (M5 closure: trailing-whitespace tolerance)
  - `_VECTOR_ID_RE` — schema-shape regex (M1 closure: path-traversal defense)
  - `_FIXTURE_CATEGORY_ALLOWLIST` — frozenset of 7 enum values (M2 closure: import-allowlist gate)
  - `class FixtureMissing(Exception)` and `class ReplayFixtureMissing(Exception)`
  - `load_replay_fixture(vector_id, replay_dir=None) -> dict` with shape validation
  - `substitute_runtime_payloads(fixture, vector) -> dict` with allowlist+placeholder+module-name lookup
- **Failure modes (all wired):** REPLAY-MISSING / REPLAY-INVALID / FIXTURE-MISSING / FIXTURE-MODULE-MISSING / FIXTURE-CATEGORY-FORBIDDEN.

### T2.5 — Backfill 10 vectors across 5 Sprint-1 categories

| Category | Sprint 1 | Added | Vectors |
|---|---|---|---|
| role_switch | 4 | +2 | RT-RS-005 (above-branch redacted), RT-RS-006 (act-as-DAN wrapped) |
| tool_call_exfiltration | 4 | +2 | RT-TC-005 (hyphen-bypass wrapped), RT-TC-006 (\<execute\> wrapped) |
| credential_leak | 4 | +2 | RT-CL-005 (GCP service-account wrapped), RT-CL-006 (JWT bearer wrapped) |
| markdown_indirect | 4 | +2 | RT-MD-005 (HTML iframe wrapped), RT-MD-006 (meta-refresh wrapped) |
| unicode_obfuscation | 4 | +2 | RT-UN-005 (combining-acute wrapped), RT-UN-006 (tag-char wrapped) |

Per-vector defensibility: every vector cites a real attack class (OWASP-LLM-01, OWASP-LLM-06, Anthropic-paper, DAN-vN, in-house-cypherpunk regex-coverage probe), and every `expected_outcome` was OBSERVED against the live SUT before writing.

### T2.6 — Apparatus tests

- **File added:** `tests/unit/test_replay_harness.py` (~370 lines, 27 tests).
- **TestLoadReplayFixture (10 tests):** happy path + missing file + malformed JSON + top-level array + missing turns + empty turns + missing role + invalid role + per-turn count length mismatch + negative count.
- **TestSubstituteRuntimePayloads (6 tests):** placeholder substitution + no-mutation + missing-fixture + unknown-category + non-placeholder-passthrough + trailing-whitespace (M5 regression test).
- **TestVectorIdAndCategoryGuards (5 tests):** path traversal + slash + lowercase + os category + subprocess category — ALL added by M1+M2 closures.
- **TestSubprocessIsolation (2 tests):** env-non-propagation (with H2-closure additional `hello` non-presence check) + identical-payload-byte-equal-output (H2 closure positive control).
- **TestRedactionCountSemantics (4 tests):** role-switch trigger + benign + code-fence + failure-message format.

### T2.7 — Cypherpunk dual-review

**Two-source dual review:**
1. **Inline /implement T2.7** — paranoid-cypherpunk subagent (general-purpose) during the implementation pass. 12 findings, 8 closed inline (3 HIGH + 5 MED + bonus L1+L4 LOW), 2 LOW deferred.
2. **/review-sprint Phase 2.5 cross-model** — claude-opus-4-7 (rolled back from gpt-5.5-pro per #787) ran against the Sprint 2 diff with the engineer-reviewer's concerns appended as context. 6 findings: 1 BLOCKING (DISS-001) cross-validated this reviewer's NEW-B1; 2 BLOCKING (DISS-002, DISS-003) verified by direct probe and downgraded — DISS-002 is a LOW documentation accuracy concern (FIXTURES dict accuracy for split-payload vectors), DISS-003 is a false positive (JSON `\\b` correctly escaped on disk per `od -c` byte-level inspection). 3 ADVISORY findings (DISS-004 STYLE, DISS-005 sys.path mutation, DISS-006 cross-validates NEW-N1).

Cross-model review artifact at `grimoires/loa/a2a/sprint-144/adversarial-review.json` (status: `reviewed`, model: `claude-opus-4-7`, latency 48s, cost $0.27).

Findings + closures from BOTH sources captured below.

---

## Cypherpunk T2.7 Findings + Closures

### CRITICAL (0)

None. The core attack surface (placeholder regex, schema enum on category, content-addressable test_mode dual-gate, SDD §4.4 contract) was closed in Sprint 1.

### HIGH (3 — all closed inline)

| # | Title | File | Closure |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | `_count_redactions` matches markers anywhere in stdout including L2 envelope NOTE — false-positive risk if SUT ever quotes them | `test_replay.py:49-52` | `_ENVELOPE_BODY_RE` scopes counting to inside `<untrusted-content>...</untrusted-content>` only; envelope-absent fallback preserved for SUT-bypass observability. Also fixed in apparatus tests. |
| H2 | Subprocess-isolation test only verifies env non-propagation (vacuously-green-prone) | `test_replay_harness.py:281-310` | (a) env test tightened: pin "hello" presence in turn 1 + assert "hello" NOT in turn 2 body. (b) NEW `test_identical_payload_produces_identical_output` runs identical payload twice and asserts byte-equal stdout (a stateful SUT would diverge). |
| H3 | Aggregate 10s budget enforced only between turns; per-turn 5s timeout could push real total to 14.9s/turn × N turns | `test_replay.py:185-205` | Pass `remaining = _PER_VECTOR_TIMEOUT_SEC - elapsed` to `_invoke_sanitize_subprocess(turn_timeout=remaining)`; subprocess timeout = `max(0.1, min(5.0, turn_timeout))`. Aggregate budget now strict. |

### Post-/review-sprint additions

**NEW-B1 (HIGH, /review-sprint cross-validated by Opus DISS-001):** `_PLACEHOLDER_RE` only tolerated trailing whitespace post-M5; **leading whitespace silently bypassed substitution** (vacuously-green class symmetric to M5).

| | |
|---|---|
| **File** | `tests/red-team/jailbreak/lib/corpus_loader.py:214` |
| **Closure** | Regex updated from `r"__FIXTURE:(...)\s*"` → `r"\s*__FIXTURE:(...)\s*"` (symmetric whitespace tolerance). |
| **Apparatus pins** | `tests/unit/test_replay_harness.py` 3 new tests — `test_placeholder_with_leading_whitespace_still_substitutes`, `test_placeholder_with_leading_newline_still_substitutes`, `test_placeholder_with_both_leading_and_trailing_whitespace`. All green. |
| **Test count delta** | 39 → 42 passing (3 new pins for symmetric whitespace contract) |

### MEDIUM (5 — all closed inline)

| # | Title | File | Closure |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | `load_replay_fixture(vector_id)` path traversal when called outside parametrize | `corpus_loader.py:241-246` | `_VECTOR_ID_RE` schema-shape regex enforced at function entry; ValueError("REPLAY-INVALID: vector_id shape …"). Apparatus tests `test_path_traversal_vector_id_rejected` + `test_slash_in_vector_id_rejected` + `test_lowercase_vector_id_rejected` pin the contract. |
| M2 | `importlib.import_module(vector.category)` no allowlist | `corpus_loader.py:316` | `_FIXTURE_CATEGORY_ALLOWLIST` frozenset gate; FixtureMissing("FIXTURE-CATEGORY-FORBIDDEN: …"). Apparatus tests `test_non_allowlist_category_rejected` (os) + `test_non_allowlist_subprocess_category_rejected` pin. |
| M3 | RT-MT-007 framing — fence-precedence is operator-visibility finding, not "defense gap" | `corpus/multi_turn_conditioning.jsonl:19` | `notes` re-framed: defense holds (trigger text removed) but audit log records only fence marker — operators reviewing audit logs cannot tell from the marker that a role-switch was attempted. Title updated to "(operator-visibility finding)". |
| M4 | `_emit_audit_run_entry` swallows non-zero exit silently (regressed F10 closure from runner.bats Sprint 1) | `test_replay.py:103-106` | Capture `r = subprocess.run(...)` and check `r.returncode != 0`; log to stderr; raise under `LOA_JAILBREAK_STRICT_AUDIT=1` env (mirrors L4/L7 strict-mode pattern). |
| M5 | `_PLACEHOLDER_RE` does not handle trailing whitespace — placeholder pass-through silently produces vacuously-green vectors | `corpus_loader.py:214` | `re.fullmatch(r"__FIXTURE:(_make_evil_body_[a-z0-9_]+)__\s*", content)` allows trailing whitespace; apparatus test `test_placeholder_with_trailing_whitespace_still_substitutes` pins. |

### LOW (4 — deferred to follow-up tracker)

| # | Title | Defer to | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | `passed-through-unchanged` branch — closed inline (bonus) | Sprint 2 (closed) | Tightened with `last_stdout.strip() != ""` assertion; closed despite being LOW. |
| L2 | bats audit-emit propagation lacks unit-test pin under gather-phase `set -e` strip | cycle-101 | The F10 closure is correct in spirit; pin can land separately when bats-test-of-bats infrastructure is needed. |
| L3 | `validate_all` re-loop in `iter_active` is `# pragma: no cover` dead defense-in-depth | cycle-101 | Cleanup PR; not load-bearing this sprint. |
| L4 | `test_each_turn_runs_in_fresh_bash_process` — closed inline (bonus) | Sprint 2 (closed) | Added turn 1 stdout shape assertions (`<untrusted-content` + payload echo). |

L1 and L4 closed inline as part of H1/H2 fixes — the cypherpunk's review correctly identified them as small enough to land alongside the higher-severity fixes. L2 + L3 deferred.

### PRAISE (4)

P1: F10 closure on audit-emit propagation in runner.bats (cycle-098 reference comment durable across maintainers).
P2: Schema-first corpus validation at runner.bats source-time BAIL gate before any payload work.
P3: `_PLACEHOLDER_RE` is anchored, deliberately NOT mid-string searchable, with `test_non_placeholder_content_passes_through` regression test.
P4: NFR-Sec1 runtime construction discipline maintained across all 10 backfill fixtures (consistent `f"{a}{b}{c}"` concatenation pattern).

---

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture: per-turn statelessness validation

The harness's load-bearing claim is that each turn's `sanitize_for_session_start` invocation is independent. The H2 closure tightens the subprocess-isolation pin from "env vars don't propagate" (true-by-OS-construction) to "byte-equal output for byte-equal input" (true only if the SUT is genuinely stateless). This is the regression pin a future stateful-SUT regression would trip first.

### Security: triple-gate on placeholder substitution

After T2.7 closures, the substitution path enforces:
1. **Schema-shape gate (M1):** `vector_id` must match `^RT-[A-Z]{2,3}-\d{3,4}$` before any pathlib operation.
2. **Allowlist gate (M2):** `vector.category` must be in `_FIXTURE_CATEGORY_ALLOWLIST` before any `importlib.import_module`.
3. **Function-name regex gate (Sprint 1 + M5):** placeholder must match `__FIXTURE:(_make_evil_body_[a-z0-9_]+)__\s*` (anchored, lowercase-only function name, trailing whitespace tolerated).

This mirrors the L7 sprint 7 cypherpunk HIGH-1 closure (path-containment) and L4 cycle-099 #761 closure (test-mode dual-condition gate) patterns.

### Audit: M4 closure mirrors Sprint 1 F10

The M4 closure brings the Python harness into parity with the bash runner's F10 closure (Sprint 1 cypherpunk). Both now refuse to silently swallow audit-emit failures, surfacing non-zero exits to stderr (and optionally raising under `LOA_JAILBREAK_STRICT_AUDIT=1`).

### Performance: aggregate-budget enforcement

H3 closure ensures the 10s per-vector aggregate budget is *enforced*, not just *advisory*. A turn that starts with `remaining=2s` of budget gets `subprocess.run(timeout=2.0)`, not the legacy 5s default. This closes a worst-case path where 5 turns × 5s subprocess timeout could run for 25s while the harness reported "within budget."

### Run commands

```bash
# Single-shot vectors (35 tests)
bats tests/red-team/jailbreak/runner.bats

# Multi-turn replay harness (12 tests)
python3 -m pytest tests/red-team/jailbreak/test_replay.py -v

# Apparatus tests (27 tests)

```

Total wallclock: ~8s for the full Sprint-2 surface.

---

## Known Limitations

1. **AC-8 standalone replay CLI ⚠ Partial:** A direct CLI for invoking the replay harness on a single vector_id is not shipped this sprint. Pytest entrypoint works; ad-hoc invocation defers to Sprint 4 README docs. Workaround: `pytest -k RT-MT-009 tests/red-team/jailbreak/test_replay.py`.
2. **RT-MT-007 audit-visibility finding (M3 closure):** The fence-precedence vector documents that operators reviewing audit logs cannot tell from the marker that a role-switch was nested inside the fence. Cycle-101 may add a finer marker; for now the vector ships with re-framed `notes` documenting the finding.
3. **L2 + L3 LOW findings deferred:** bats audit-emit propagation pin + `iter_active` re-loop dead-code cleanup deferred to cycle-101 follow-up.
4. **Sprint-1 deferred items propagate forward:** MED-001 (run_id collision under concurrent matrix) and MED-002 (per-entry python spawn for codepoint truncation) remain Sprint-4-and-beyond items.
