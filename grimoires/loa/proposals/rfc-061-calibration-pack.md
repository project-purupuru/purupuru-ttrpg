# RFC-061: Polycentric Model-Calibration Pack (v3.1, Flatline-iterated)

**Status**: Draft (supersedes v1 closed #572, v2 closed #580; v3 → v3.1 in same PR #581)
**Tracker**: [#556](https://github.com/0xHoneyJar/loa/issues/556)
**Meta tracker**: [#557](https://github.com/0xHoneyJar/loa/issues/557) (Tier 3)
**Author**: Agent (proposal for maintainer review)
**Date**: 2026-04-18
**Review provenance**: Flatline 3-model adversarial review on v2 → v3 (9 BLOCKER + 6 HIGH_CONSENSUS). v3 re-Flatlined → 7 BLOCKER + 5 HIGH_CONSENSUS (now finer-grained). v3.1 addresses those 12.

## What v3 fixes vs v2

v2 borrowed patterns from deterministic-software lineage (Google Progen, SLSA, Bazel) without adapting for LLM-specific reality. Flatline flagged 5 structural issues:

| # | v2 flaw | Flatline ref | v3 fix |
|---|---------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | "Reinvented protobuf poorly" via custom YAML-as-schema | SKP-001×2, IMP-001 | **Drop custom DSL. Use JSON Schema** (draft-07) as authoring surface. Validate with ajv at load time. |
| 2 | Golden corpus assumed exact-match on LLM output | SKP-002×2, SKP-004, IMP-005 | **Rubric-based LLM-as-judge scoring** with semantic-equivalence tolerance. Bootstrap from a pinned reference calibration, not current production. |
| 3 | "Compile-time safety" overstated for bash/YAML runtime | SKP-002-dup, SKP-003 | Renamed throughout: **load-time validation**, not compile-time. Bash accessors generated with strict quoting + explicit untrusted-input posture. |
| 4 | Supply-chain deferred to Phase 2 while MVP ships packs | SKP-007 | **Minimal SHA256 verification is MVP-required**. Sigstore remains Phase 2 but mandatory-hash is not. |
| 5 | Claims without specification (canonicalization, threshold, migration) | IMP-002/003/004, SKP-005, SKP-006 | Normative specs added inline (§§ below). |

## The Five Patterns (v3 form)

### P1. Schema + codegen via JSON Schema

**Was**: custom YAML-as-schema.
**Is**: **JSON Schema draft-07** as authoring surface. Existing standard, mature tooling, ajv/jsonschema validators available in every language we use.

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "$id": "https://loa.sh/schemas/calibration.v1.json",
  "title": "Calibration",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "schema_version": {"const": 1},
    "calibration_id":  {"type": "string", "pattern": "^[a-z0-9-]+$"},
    "model_family":    {"type": "string", "enum": ["anthropic", "openai", "google"]},
    "effective":       {"type": "string", "format": "date"},
    "interview":       {"$ref": "#/definitions/InterviewPosture"},
    "known_antipatterns": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {"$ref": "#/definitions/Antipattern"}
    },
    "calibration_hash": {"type": "string", "pattern": "^sha256:[0-9a-f]{64}$"}
  },
  "required": ["schema_version", "calibration_id", "model_family", "calibration_hash"]
}
```

Python consumes via `jsonschema.validate(instance, schema)` at load time. Bash consumes via generated getters that `jq -r` the validated instance — never source untrusted content. TypeScript gets types via `json-schema-to-typescript`.

**Load-time validation, not compile-time.** The schema ensures: required fields present, types correct, enum values within allowed set, regex patterns match. Ill-formed instances fail at `/loa calibrate --apply` or `--audit-calibration` — not at some theoretical compile step.

**Bash getter safety discipline** (closes SKP-003, IMP-001): generated `calibration-getters.sh` follows strict rules:

- Values read via `jq -r '.field'` **only**; never `source` pack content or `eval` any string derived from it
- Emit via `printf '%s\n' "$value"`, never unquoted expansion
- All arguments to generated functions quoted double at every expansion
- Test harness (`tests/unit/calibration-getter-safety.bats`) fires a fuzz corpus (shell-metachars, newlines, null bytes, unicode edge cases) at getters; any non-literal echo is a test failure
- Threat model documented: getters operate on JSON that passed schema validation; if the schema didn't catch a value, the getter must still emit it as a literal string, never execute it

```bash
# Generated getter pattern (what v3.1 emits)
calibration_get_interview_mode() {
    local cal_path="$1"  # Path to validated calibration JSON
    jq -r '.interview.default_mode // "minimal"' "$cal_path"
    # Never: `eval "$(jq -r ... )"` or `source <(... )`
}
```

**Codegen staleness check** (closes IMP-005): `gen-calibration-bindings.sh --check` runs in CI; emits non-zero if the checked-in generated files don't match regenerated output. Prevents schema/runtime drift.

### P2. Golden corpus with stochastic-tolerant semantics

**Was**: "skills pass this calibration's goldens" — implicit exact-match.
**Is**: **rubric-based scoring with LLM-as-judge.** Two modes:

- **Structural rubric** (deterministic, fast): must-have sections, token budget, valid JSON/YAML, required field names. jq predicates over parseable output.
- **Semantic rubric** (LLM-graded, slower): "did the PRD cover the stated goals?" graded by a separate judge model (Opus) with a scoring prompt. Pass threshold operator-configurable (default 7/10).

```yaml
# goldens/claude-opus-4-7/task-001/rubric.json
{
  "structural": {
    "must_contain_sections": ["Goals", "Acceptance Criteria", "Risks"],
    "max_token_count": 4000,
    "min_token_count": 800
  },
  "semantic": {
    "judge_model": "opus",
    "criteria": [
      "Goals are measurable (specific numeric / observable outcomes)",
      "Acceptance criteria are testable (each has a clear pass condition)",
      "Assumptions are explicit (not implied)"
    ],
    "pass_threshold": 7
  }
}
```

**Bootstrap strategy**: the **first** calibration's goldens are authored by a human reviewer, not captured from current production. Subsequent calibrations can bootstrap goldens via diff against a pinned reference calibration (explicitly documented as "regression baseline" — no blind institutionalization).

**Stochasticity tolerance**: each golden evaluates pass-rate over N invocations (**default N=5**, operator-configurable, minimum N=3). A golden "passes" if ≥⌈2N/3⌉ pass the rubric. N=5/threshold=4 gives reasonable binomial confidence; operators optimizing for speed can drop to N=3; production-grade calibrations should use N=10.

**Judge model pinning** (closes IMP-002): to avoid invalidating eval runs across judge drift, every rubric specifies the judge's **model_id + version + temperature (= 0) + seed (if supported)**. Rubric schema enforces pinning — unpinned judge rejected at load time.

**LLM-as-judge circularity** (closes SKP-001 judge-circularity): first 3-5 calibrations in the pack ship with **human-authored reference outputs**. The judge model is chosen from a **different model family** than the calibration being evaluated (Opus judges Gemini calibrations; Gemini judges Claude; GPT judges both). Ensemble threshold: when semantic score is within ±1 of the pass boundary, a second judge from a third family breaks the tie.

**Fail-closed on judge unavailability** (closes SKP-002 fail-open): if the pinned judge model is unreachable, `--apply` **refuses** with exit 13. Operator can `--force` with logged reason; telemetry captures the override. No silent fall-through to structural-only — that class of gap approves weak calibrations.

### P3. Shadow evaluation with specified threshold

**Was**: `--require-shadow-pass` refuses swap on ">N% divergence."
**Is**: divergence defined normatively as **golden-corpus pass-rate delta**:

```
divergence = pass_rate(active_calibration) − pass_rate(candidate_calibration)
```

Computed over the candidate's full golden corpus. Operator-configurable threshold (default: refuse swap if divergence > 0.15 i.e. candidate passes 15 percentage points fewer goldens than active). Explicit `--force` with logged reason allows override.

Routes through Flatline for the judge-model calls — existing primitive, no new model-plumbing.

### P4. Provenance with specified canonicalization

**Was**: `calibration_hash` pinnable.
**Is**: `calibration_hash` computed over **RFC 8785 JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS)** output of the calibration instance, excluding the hash field itself. Normative spec:

```python
def compute_hash(calibration: dict) -> str:
    # Per RFC 8785:
    # - Remove the `calibration_hash` field (self-referential)
    # - Canonicalize keys (sort, UTF-8, lowercase hex escapes)
    # - Strip whitespace
    canonical = rfc8785.canonicalize({k: v for k, v in calibration.items() if k != "calibration_hash"})
    return "sha256:" + hashlib.sha256(canonical.encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()
```

**Mandatory-hash is MVP** (closes SKP-007 gap): `/loa calibrate --apply` refuses to load a calibration whose stored `calibration_hash` doesn't match computed-hash. Prevents accidental tampering without requiring Sigstore.

**Optional Sigstore** signing remains Phase 2.

**Pinning**:

```yaml
model_calibration:
  active: claude-opus-4-7
  pinned_hash: sha256:a3f2b1...  # must match computed-hash of active calibration
```

Operators running identical (schema_version, calibration_id, pinned_hash) across machines get identical behavior at the configuration layer. Vendor nondeterminism (SKP-005) is explicitly **not** claimed — the hash covers calibration CONTENT, not OUTPUTS. Downstream goldens + shadow eval handle model drift empirically.

### P5. Telemetry tagging (unchanged from v2)

Skill wrappers log `active_calibration_id + calibration_hash` to trajectory. Quality metrics (review severity, audit severity, cost per phase, golden pass-rate) bucket by calibration. Uses existing trajectory JSONL infra.

## Decisions (v3)

| Decision | v3 |
|----------|-----|
| **D1 Location** | Schema in `.claude/schemas/` (core); calibrations in `.loa/constructs/packs/model-calibrations/` (pack). Schema evolves with Loa releases; calibrations ship independently via pack registry. |
| **D2 Versioning** | JSON Schema `$id` URL carries version (`calibration.v1.json`). Compat contract: **writers may add optional fields freely**; **removing or changing the type of a field requires a version bump AND retention of old field as deprecated for ≥2 Loa minor cycles**. Migration rules specified inline in schema change log. |
| **D3 Trigger** | Manual via `/loa calibrate --apply <id>`. Opt-in shadow-eval gate via `--require-shadow-pass`. Mandatory hash verification in all paths (MVP requirement). |

## Schema/Instance Compat Contract (closes SKP-006, IMP-004)

| Change class | Permitted without version bump? | Reader behavior |
|--------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| Add optional field | ✓ | v1 readers ignore |
| Add required field (any form) | ✗ — **always requires major bump** (SKP-004 tightened v3 → v3.1: readers without the field semantics can't safely default) | v1 readers reject unknown required fields |
| Remove field | ✗ — requires major bump; field stays as `deprecated: true` for 2 minor cycles | v1 readers warn on deprecated, refuse after 2 cycles |
| Change field type | ✗ — requires major bump | — |
| Tighten enum values | ✗ — requires major bump | — |
| Loosen enum values (add value) | ✓ but requires **per-field policy in schema**: `onUnknownValue: reject | warn | passthrough` (defaults to reject). Schema MUST specify this for every string-enum field. |

**Reader/writer divergence guard** (closes SKP-004): the schema itself carries machine-readable semantics for each loosenable change — no reader needs to guess what to do with an unknown enum value. Writers bumping a minor version of the pack must also bump schema if any field's policy changes.

Explicit rule: if a pack's `required_schema_version` > local Loa's `schema_version`, `/loa calibrate --apply` **refuses** with message pointing at the needed upgrade.

## Failure Semantics (closes IMP-007)

Explicit on each failure path:

| Failure | Behavior | Error exit |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Schema validation fails | Refuse apply; stderr lists failing JSON pointers | 10 |
| Hash mismatch on `pinned_hash` | Refuse apply; print "Pinned hash doesn't match computed. Pack may have been tampered with, or pin is stale." | 11 |
| Schema version skew (pack > local) | Refuse apply; print "Pack needs Loa ≥ $minimum_version. Run /update-loa." | 12 |
| Golden run fails (structural) | Emit finding, mark calibration `status: failing_goldens`; downstream `audit-calibration` reports | 0 (soft) |
| Golden run fails (semantic judge unavailable) | **Refuse apply** (v3.1 tightened from fall-through). Operator `--force` allows with logged reason. | 13 without force, 0 with |
| Shadow eval unavailable (Flatline down) | `--require-shadow-pass` refuses apply; `--force` allows with logged reason | 13 without force, 0 with |
| Calibration file missing from pack | Refuse apply; print available calibrations in the pack | 14 |

## MVP Scope (revised)

**Sprint 1 — Schema + validation**:
- `.claude/schemas/calibration.schema.json` (JSON Schema draft-07)
- `.claude/scripts/gen-calibration-bindings.sh` (emits Python dataclasses, bash getters, TS types)
- `validate_calibration()` function + hash verification
- BATS + pytest: schema validates canonical instances; invalid instances fail with JSON Pointer locations

**Sprint 2 — Pack + hash + apply**:
- `.loa/constructs/packs/model-calibrations/` skeleton with claude-opus-4-7 seed
- `/loa calibrate list` / `/loa calibrate --apply <id>` with hash verification
- `.loa.config.yaml` keys: `model_calibration.active`, `model_calibration.pinned_hash`
- Telemetry tagging on skill invocations

**Sprint 3 — Goldens + shadow eval**:
- `goldens/claude-opus-4-7/` with 3-5 canonical tasks
- `.claude/scripts/run-goldens.sh <calibration_id>` (structural + semantic rubrics)
- `calibration-shadow-eval.sh` wrapper around Flatline
- `/loa calibrate --apply <id> --require-shadow-pass`
- `/loa audit-calibration` (dry-run against active)

**Phase 2 (post-MVP)**:
- Sigstore signing
- Auto-vendor-release detection
- Per-skill calibration overrides
- Golden authoring tooling (bootstrap from reference + diff visualization)
- Pack registry for third-party calibrations

## Non-Goals

- Replace `.claude/rules/` prose invariants
- Block merge on calibration mismatch (warn in `/update-loa`, don't refuse)
- Sandbox untrusted pack content (beyond hash + MVP posture of "don't source raw YAML as bash")
- Auto-detect vendor model releases (Phase 2+)

## Supply-chain scope (v3.1 acknowledgment)

Flatline's SKP-001 (score 910) is right: SHA256 alone prevents accidental tampering but does not establish publisher authenticity. v3.1's honest scope:

- **MVP (mandatory)**: SHA256 verification — catches integrity breaks, not authorship attacks
- **Phase 2 (post-MVP)**: Sigstore signing — attests authorship
- **Interim bridge (no code needed)**: downstream operators can gate pack adoption on GitHub's `gh attestation verify` against PRs that add calibrations. Not enforced in MVP, but a documented option for security-conscious operators until Phase 2 lands

The v2 framing that implied SHA256 closed the supply-chain gap was wrong. v3.1 explicitly scopes: integrity yes, authenticity no — until Phase 2.

## Bootstrap authoring standards (closes IMP-006)

The first calibration's goldens are the anchor for all downstream bootstrapping. Authoring requirements:

- **Human-reviewed reference outputs** — not captured from current production. An operator writes the "ideal PRD for this prompt" by hand, informed by the calibration's stated posture (interview mode, thinking budget, etc.)
- **Rubric specificity** — structural rubric MUST include ≥3 observable predicates; semantic rubric MUST include ≥2 criteria with explicit pass/fail thresholds
- **One full worked example** ships in the pack's `docs/bootstrap-example.md` — shows how task-001 was authored from raw prompt → rubric → reference output, including judge selection rationale
- **Review stage** — each new golden passes independent review (Flatline on the rubric itself) before being accepted into the pack

Subsequent calibrations (the 2nd onward) can diff-bootstrap from the pinned reference. The diff visualizer (`/loa calibrate --diff-goldens ref:<id> target:<id>`) shows how the candidate's rubric shifts from the reference, so human reviewers judge the delta.

## Anti-Patterns Cited by Flatline, Not Introduced in v3

- ❌ Custom DSL for schema → use JSON Schema
- ❌ Exact-match golden eval on prose → rubric-based with stochastic tolerance
- ❌ "Compile-time" claims over bash/YAML runtime → load-time validation
- ❌ Unbounded bash-sourced artifacts → `jq -r` + explicit escaping in generated getters, never `source` pack content
- ❌ Handwavy "N% divergence" → normative pass-rate delta with default threshold 0.15
- ❌ Deferred supply-chain while MVP ships packs → mandatory SHA256 verification in MVP
- ❌ Claims of reproducibility that conflate content-hash with output-determinism → hash explicitly scoped to content

## Ask

Maintainer review of the decisions, compat contract, failure semantics, and sprint breakdown. The v3 doc is honest about limits (stochastic model output, load-time-not-compile-time, content-hash-not-output-determinism) and explicit about claims (canonicalization via RFC 8785, pass-rate delta metric, migration rules).

If any pattern is still too ambitious for MVP, say which. Sprint 1 alone delivers core value (schema + validated bindings + hash verification). Sprints 2-3 are additive.
