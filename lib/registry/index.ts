/**
 * The Registry Of Registries — single source of truth for "what mutable
 * state exists in this app, and where does it live."
 *
 * Doctrine: grimoires/loa/proposals/registry-doctrine-2026-05-12.md
 *
 * Convention:
 *   - Every singleton ENGINE goes here (mutable, RAF/audio-context-owning)
 *   - Every static REGISTRY goes here (immutable lookup tables)
 *   - Every MutationGuard goes here
 *   - Consumers import { registry } from "@/lib/registry"
 *   - Direct imports from the registry's source file are a smell —
 *     route through this file so dependencies are auditable by grep
 *
 * AI grounding:
 *   - When asking "where does X live?" — read THIS file.
 *   - When adding a new shared mutable — add it HERE.
 *   - When a registry isn't here, it's a defect or it's intentionally
 *     out of scope (UI-local state, MatchSnapshot which has its own
 *     reducer-shaped contract).
