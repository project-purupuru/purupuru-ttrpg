/**
 * S2-T4 · Vercel KV nonce store · atomic check-and-set replay protection
 *
 * Per SDD r2 §3.3 (HIGH-2 + HIGH-780 fixes):
 *
 *   - Vercel KV (durable Redis) NOT in-memory Set · cross-instance durability on
 *     Vercel's stateless function model is mandatory (multiple lambdas could
 *     otherwise see the same nonce as fresh).
 *   - `SET key value NX EX 300` · single atomic operation · NOT GET-then-SET
 *     (race window). NX returns "OK" only when key didn't exist, null otherwise.
 *     5-minute TTL matches ClaimMessage.expiresAt window · auto-cleanup.
 *   - strongly-consistent reads · single-region iad1 · these are configured at
 *     KV provisioning time on Vercel (NOT settable here · documented for ops).
 *   - fail-closed: KV unreachable → "kv-down" → caller returns 503 (not 400) so
 *     users retry rather than giving up. Throwing through the call site would
 *     also work but a ternary return keeps the API surface small.
 *
 * Threat model · why "replay" is a hard reject:
 *   The same nonce twice means a) the user is retrying (rare · minted already)
 *   or b) an attacker is replaying a captured tx (more likely after the first
 *   claim). Either way · refuse. The off-chain claim_genesis_stone signed bytes
 *   are valid forever within their expiresAt window if no nonce store enforces
 *   single-use; the nonce is the only thing preventing a captured POST-mint
 *   response from being submitted to chain twice.
