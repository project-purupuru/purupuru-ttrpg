/**
 * Battle conditions — the per-match imbalance modifier.
 *
 * Each element brings a different way of warping the puzzle:
 *   - Wood "Growing"  · late positions hit harder
 *   - Fire "Volatile" · early positions hit harder
 *   - Earth "Steady"  · center positions strengthened
 *   - Metal "Precise" · the single biggest clash is doubled
 *   - Water "Tidal"   · all shifts amplified — bigger swings
 *
 * Lifted from purupuru-game/prototype/src/lib/game/conditions.ts.
