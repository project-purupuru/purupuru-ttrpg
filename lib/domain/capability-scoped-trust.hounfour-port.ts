 *
 * REFERENCE-ONLY in this cycle (per S0-T2 conformance map). Compass S3 force-
 * chain mapping references this contract conceptually but does NOT yet wire
 * it to runtime decisions. When verify⊥judge fence (S3) needs trust-level
 * gating per capability scope, this port is the source of truth.
