# VESTIGIAL — cycle-103 sprint-1 T1.8 / AC-1.3
# ============================================================================
# This NODE_OPTIONS Happy Eyeballs fix is preserved at merge time per AC-1.5
# but is no longer load-bearing. After cycle-103 sprint-1 unification, BB no
# longer issues fetch() to provider APIs from Node — every LLM-API call goes
# through .claude/adapters/cheval.py (via ChevalDelegateAdapter, commits
# 1e1381dd + 92c0057e). Python httpx does not depend on Node's
# --network-family-autoselection-attempt-timeout. The KF-001 failure mode
# the flag was added to mitigate (cross-model degradation on
# slow-but-reachable IPv4 paths) is now isolated to whatever Node fetch
# remains in github-cli.ts and similar GitHub-API paths — NOT to LLM calls.
#
# TODO(cycle-104+): remove this entire NODE_OPTIONS block AND its companion
# LOA_BB_DISABLE_FAMILY_TIMEOUT_FIX env hatch. Removal is gated on:
#   1. Observable operator-green signal across ≥1 full cycle that the
#      cheval delegate path remains the BB hot path for provider calls.
#      (Cycle-104 sprint-2 T2.14 removed the companion
#      LOA_BB_FORCE_LEGACY_FETCH operator-rollback signal because the
#      legacy fetch path it gated was already gone — the constructor
#      check is no longer load-bearing.)
#   2. Confirmation that github-cli.ts and other Node fetch sites do not
#      hit the same Happy Eyeballs failure mode (KF-001 is provider-API
#      specific per the original diagnostic).
# Until both gates are met, the flag stays for safety.
#
# Tracked by tests/unit/entry-sh-node-options-vestigial.bats which fails
# if the VESTIGIAL marker is removed without the companion cycle-104
# removal landing.

# Happy Eyeballs autoselection-attempt-timeout (cycle-102 sprint-1E / KF-001 fix).
#
# Node 20+ undici fetch uses RFC 8305 Happy Eyeballs to race concurrent IPv6 +
# IPv4 connection attempts. The default --network-family-autoselection-attempt-
# timeout is 250ms — when an attempt does not complete a TCP handshake within
# that window, Node aborts it and aggregates the failure. On networks where
# IPv4 TCP handshake to specific provider endpoints (api.anthropic.com,
# generativelanguage.googleapis.com) routinely takes >250ms (common with
# slow-but-reachable IPv4 paths through DDoS protection layers like Cloudflare),
# the attempt is killed before TCP completes and Node reports
# `TypeError: fetch failed; cause=AggregateError [ETIMEDOUT]`. This presented
# as full bridgebuilder degradation across 3 invocations on PR #826 (KF-001
# in grimoires/loa/known-failures.md), with anthropic + google failing while
# openai succeeded — openai's faster IPv4 path completed inside 250ms.
#
# Bumping the autoselection-attempt-timeout to 5000ms gives each connection
# attempt enough time to complete the TCP+TLS handshake on slow-but-reachable
# IPv4 paths. Effects:
#   - Users with working IPv6: no slowdown — IPv6 wins fast; autoselection
#     completes in tens of milliseconds. The 5000ms is a CEILING, not a delay.
#   - Users with broken IPv6 (EADDRNOTAVAIL or no v6 stack): autoselection
#     waits up to 5s for IPv4 to complete the handshake. Real-world IPv4
#     handshakes complete in 1-3s on this class of network.
#   - Users with both broken: waits 5s before declaring failure (vs 250ms
#     previously). Acceptable for the rare full-network-outage case.
#
# Honors existing NODE_OPTIONS (appends rather than overwrites) so operators
# who set their own NODE_OPTIONS don't get clobbered. The flag has been
# available since Node 18.18 / 20.0 — covered by the engines.node >=20.0.0
# pin in package.json. Set LOA_BB_DISABLE_FAMILY_TIMEOUT_FIX=1 to opt out.
#
# Diagnostic evidence (commit message of this patch references upstream issue):
#   - Direct curl to api.anthropic.com IPv4 succeeds in 0.9-3s
#   - Python httpx (cheval.py) succeeds against all 3 providers
#   - Node fetch fails with: sub-error[0] ETIMEDOUT IPv4-addr,
#     sub-error[1] EADDRNOTAVAIL IPv6-addr (no v6 stack)
#   - With --network-family-autoselection-attempt-timeout=5000: Node
#     fetch returns HTTP 401 (correct auth-failure response) instantly.
