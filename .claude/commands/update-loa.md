# Update Loa

## Purpose

Pull the latest Loa framework updates from the upstream repository. Safely fetches, previews changes, and merges with guidance for conflict resolution.

## Invocation

```
/update-loa
/update-loa main
/update-loa feature/constructs-multiselect
```

## WIP Branch Testing (v1.2.0)

When a feature branch is specified (matching `feature/*`, `fix/*`, `topic/*`, `wip/*`, or `test/*`), the command offers two options via AskUserQuestion:

1. **Checkout for testing (Recommended)** - Creates a local `test/loa-{branch}` branch from the remote
2. **Merge into current branch** - Traditional merge behavior

### Branch Testing Flow

```
/update-loa feature/constructs-multiselect
    ↓
AskUserQuestion: "How would you like to use this branch?"
    ↓
[Checkout] → Creates test/loa-feature/constructs-multiselect
           → Saves state to .loa/branch-testing.json
           → "Ready for testing. Run /update-loa to return."
    ↓
[Later: /update-loa with no args while in test branch]
    ↓
AskUserQuestion: "You're testing loa/feature/constructs-multiselect"
    ↓
[Return to main] → Checks out original branch
                 → Clears state file
```

### Configuration

```yaml
# .loa.config.yaml
update_loa:
  branch_testing:
    enabled: true
    feature_patterns:
      - "feature/*"
      - "fix/*"
      - "topic/*"
      - "wip/*"
      - "test/*"
    test_branch_prefix: "test/loa-"
```

### AskUserQuestion Integration

**Branch mode selection** (when feature branch detected):

```yaml
questions:
  - question: "How would you like to use branch '{branch}'?"
    header: "Branch mode"
    options:
      - label: "Checkout for testing (Recommended)"
        description: "Switch to test/loa-{branch} for isolated testing"
      - label: "Merge into current branch"
        description: "Merge changes into your current branch ({current})"
    multiSelect: false
```

**Return helper** (when in test branch and no args):

```yaml
questions:
  - question: "You're testing loa/{branch}. What would you like to do?"
    header: "Test branch"
    options:
      - label: "Return to {original} (Recommended)"
        description: "Checkout original branch and clear test state"
      - label: "Stay on test branch"
        description: "Continue testing, keep state"
      - label: "Merge into {original}"
        description: "Merge test branch changes into original"
    multiSelect: false
```

### State Management

State is tracked via `.claude/scripts/branch-state.sh`:

```bash
# Check if in test mode
.claude/scripts/branch-state.sh is-testing

# Load state
.claude/scripts/branch-state.sh load
# → {"testing_branch":"feature/foo","original_branch":"main",...}

# Clear after return
.claude/scripts/branch-state.sh clear
```

## Prerequisites

- Working tree must be clean (no uncommitted changes)
- `loa` or `upstream` remote must be configured
- Merge driver configured (one-time): `git config merge.ours.driver true`

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Pre-flight Checks

1. Verify working tree is clean
2. Verify upstream remote exists

### Phase 2: Fetch Updates

```bash
git fetch loa main
```

### Phase 3: Show Changes

- Count new commits
- Display commit list
- Show files that will change

### Phase 4: Confirm Update

Ask for confirmation before merging. Note which files will be updated vs preserved.

### Phase 5: Merge Updates (with --no-commit)

```bash
git merge loa/main --no-commit
```

> **IMPORTANT**: The `--no-commit` flag stages the merge without committing, allowing
> Phases 5.3 and 5.5 to inspect and fix collateral damage before the commit is created.
> HEAD still points to the pre-merge branch tip during these phases.
>
> **Conflict handling**: If `git merge --no-commit` exits non-zero due to conflicts,
> resolve conflicts first (see Phase 6), then proceed to Phase 5.3. The safeguard
> operates on staged deletions (`--diff-filter=D`) which are present even during a
> conflicted merge state — conflicted files show as "both modified", not as deletions.

### Phase 5.3: Collateral Safeguard (v1.3.0, extended v1.40.0)

After the merge is staged but before committing, scan for two categories of collateral damage:

1. **Deletions** (`--diff-filter=D`): Files deleted by upstream cleanup that should not propagate
2. **Content replacements** (`--diff-filter=M`): Project identity files whose content was overwritten by upstream's version during merge conflict resolution

```bash
# --- Part 1: Collateral deletion protection (v1.3.0) ---
# Identify files staged for deletion by the merge
deleted_files=$(git diff --cached --diff-filter=D --name-only)
restored_count=0

if [[ -n "$deleted_files" ]]; then
  while IFS= read -r file; do
    case "$file" in
      # Framework zone — upstream deletions are intentional, allow them
      .claude/*) ;;
      .loa-version.json) ;;
      CLAUDE.md) ;;
      PROCESS.md) ;;
      .gitattributes) ;;
      INSTALLATION.md) ;;
      .loa.config.yaml.example) ;;
      # Everything else — non-framework file, restore from pre-merge state
      *)
        git checkout HEAD -- "$file" 2>/dev/null && restored_count=$((restored_count + 1)) || true
        ;;
    esac
  done <<< "$deleted_files"

  if [[ $restored_count -gt 0 ]]; then
    echo "Safeguard: restored $restored_count non-framework files that would have been deleted by upstream merge"
  fi
fi

# --- Part 2: Identity file content-replacement protection (v1.40.0) ---
# Project identity files describe YOUR project, not the framework.
# Merge conflict resolution (especially --theirs) can silently replace
# downstream content with upstream's version. This is invisible to
# --diff-filter=D because the file is modified, not deleted.
#
# Fixes: #439 — BUTTERFREEZONE.md overwritten during /update-loa
identity_files="README.md CHANGELOG.md BUTTERFREEZONE.md"
identity_restored=0

for identity_file in $identity_files; do
  # Only check if the file existed before the merge AND was modified by it
  if git show "HEAD:$identity_file" >/dev/null 2>&1 && \
     git diff --cached --diff-filter=M --name-only | grep -qxF "$identity_file"; then
    git checkout HEAD -- "$identity_file" 2>/dev/null && identity_restored=$((identity_restored + 1)) || true
  fi
done

if [[ $identity_restored -gt 0 ]]; then
  echo "Safeguard: restored $identity_restored project identity files that would have been overwritten by upstream merge"
fi
```

> **Why deletions?** When upstream performs cleanup (removing template/example files), `git merge`
> propagates those deletions to downstream projects that share git history. This safeguard
> uses an allowlist of framework-managed paths — only deletions within the framework zone
> are permitted. All other files are restored from HEAD (pre-merge state), preserving
> downstream application code, configurations, and documentation.
>
> **Why content replacements?** Project identity files (README.md, CHANGELOG.md, BUTTERFREEZONE.md)
> are generated per-project and describe YOUR project. When merge conflicts on these files are
> resolved with `--theirs`, the downstream project's identity is silently replaced with upstream's.
> The `--diff-filter=D` check cannot catch this because the file is modified, not deleted.
> `.gitattributes merge=ours` is the primary defense; this check is defense-in-depth.
>
> **Fixes**: [#331](https://github.com/0xHoneyJar/loa/issues/331) — cycle-014 merge
> deleting 933 downstream project files.
> [#439](https://github.com/0xHoneyJar/loa/issues/439) — BUTTERFREEZONE.md content overwrite.

### Phase 5.5: Revert Protected Paths

Check for and revert any changes to protected paths that should not propagate to downstream projects. Since the merge is not yet committed (`--no-commit`), use `git diff --cached` and restore from `HEAD`:

```bash
# Check if .github/workflows/ has staged changes from the merge
workflow_changes=$(git diff --cached --name-only -- '.github/workflows/')
if [[ -n "$workflow_changes" ]]; then
  while IFS= read -r f; do
    if git show "HEAD:$f" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
      # File existed before merge — restore pre-merge version
      git checkout HEAD -- "$f"
    else
      # New file from upstream — unstage and remove
      git rm -f --cached "$f" 2>/dev/null || true
      rm -f "$f" 2>/dev/null || true
    fi
  done <<< "$workflow_changes"
fi
```

> **Why?** GitHub requires the `workflow` OAuth scope to push changes to `.github/workflows/`. Most downstream users don't have this scope. The `.gitattributes` `merge=ours` rule protects existing workflow files, but new workflow files added upstream still propagate via merge. This step catches both cases. (Defense-in-depth: Phase 5.3 already handles workflow file deletions, but this phase additionally catches new and modified workflow files.)

### Phase 5.6: Bump Version Markers (v1.95+, Issue #554)

Framework-managed version markers (`.loa-version.json` + `CLAUDE.loa.md:1` header) are project-owned under the default merge resolver, so the merge keeps the local (stale) version. This phase idempotently rewrites both with the target release tag so downstream `/loa`, `loa-status.sh`, and issue triage report the correct version.

```bash
# Security: inline the bump using only trusted local utilities (jq, sed,
# awk, git) — never execute shell scripts from the just-merged tree.
# This closes the supply-chain injection path that `bash
# .claude/scripts/update-loa-bump-version.sh` would open. The sourceable
# script remains for unit testing and standalone/manual bumps; this
# inline version is the /update-loa invocation path.
_loa_bump_target=""
# Resolution chain: tag on FETCH_HEAD → upstream .loa-version.json → short SHA
if git rev-parse --verify FETCH_HEAD >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  _loa_bump_target=$(git tag --points-at FETCH_HEAD 2>/dev/null | grep -E '^v[0-9]+\.' | head -1 | sed 's/^v//' || true)
  if [[ -z "$_loa_bump_target" ]] && git show "FETCH_HEAD:.loa-version.json" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    _loa_bump_target=$(git show "FETCH_HEAD:.loa-version.json" 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.framework_version // empty' 2>/dev/null || true)
  fi
  if [[ -z "$_loa_bump_target" ]]; then
    _loa_bump_target=$(git rev-parse --short FETCH_HEAD 2>/dev/null || true)
  fi
fi

# Strict format validation (semver or 7-40 hex SHA) — reject injection shapes
_loa_bump_valid=false
if [[ "$_loa_bump_target" =~ ^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+([-.][A-Za-z0-9._-]+)?(\+[A-Za-z0-9.-]+)?$ ]]; then
  _loa_bump_valid=true
elif [[ "$_loa_bump_target" =~ ^[0-9a-f]{7,40}$ ]]; then
  _loa_bump_valid=true
fi

if [[ "$_loa_bump_valid" == "true" ]]; then
  # Bump .loa-version.json (idempotent, atomic)
  if [[ -f .loa-version.json ]] && command -v jq >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    _loa_current=$(jq -r '.framework_version // empty' .loa-version.json 2>/dev/null || true)
    if [[ "$_loa_current" != "$_loa_bump_target" ]]; then
      _loa_now=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
      jq --arg v "$_loa_bump_target" --arg t "$_loa_now" \
        '.framework_version = $v | .last_sync = $t' \
        .loa-version.json > .loa-version.json.tmp.$$ && \
        mv .loa-version.json.tmp.$$ .loa-version.json
    fi
  fi
  # Bump CLAUDE.loa.md:1 header (preserve hash + PLACEHOLDER)
  if [[ -f .claude/loa/CLAUDE.loa.md ]]; then
    _loa_header=$(head -n 1 .claude/loa/CLAUDE.loa.md)
    if [[ "$_loa_header" == *"@loa-managed: true"* ]]; then
      awk -v target="$_loa_bump_target" 'NR==1 {
        sub(/version:[[:space:]]*[^[:space:]|]+/, "version: " target)
      } { print }' .claude/loa/CLAUDE.loa.md > .claude/loa/CLAUDE.loa.md.tmp.$$ && \
        mv .claude/loa/CLAUDE.loa.md.tmp.$$ .claude/loa/CLAUDE.loa.md
    fi
  fi
  git add .loa-version.json .claude/loa/CLAUDE.loa.md 2>/dev/null || true
else
  echo "Note: version marker bump skipped — could not resolve valid target version" >&2
fi
unset _loa_bump_target _loa_bump_valid _loa_current _loa_now _loa_header
```

> **Why?** `/update-loa` Phases 5.3/5.5 protect project state and workflows. The version markers look like config but describe framework identity. Without this phase, downstream reports a stale `framework_version` across multiple updates, and the `update_available` nag fires for updates already installed. The script fails open (non-blocking) — a bump failure should not halt the merge.
>
> **Fixes**: [#554](https://github.com/0xHoneyJar/loa/issues/554) — `.loa-version.json` + `CLAUDE.loa.md` markers not refreshed by `/update-loa` merge resolution.

### Phase 5.7: Commit the Safeguarded Merge

After all safeguards have run, create the merge commit:

```bash
git commit -m "chore: update Loa framework"
```

### Phase 5.8: Sync Constructs

After the merge commit, sync construct pack skills to ensure newly added skills in pack updates are registered:

```bash
if [[ -x ".claude/scripts/sync-constructs.sh" ]]; then
  echo "Syncing construct packs..."
  .claude/scripts/sync-constructs.sh
fi
```

### Phase 6: Handle Merge Result

- **Success**: Show changelog excerpt and next steps
- **Conflicts**: List conflicted files with resolution guidance

## Arguments

| Argument | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `branch` | Branch name to update from (default: main) | No |

## Outputs

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Git merge commit | Merged upstream changes |

## Merge Strategy

| File Location | Merge Behavior |
|---------------|----------------|
| `.claude/skills/` | Updated to latest Loa versions |
| `.claude/commands/` | Updated to latest Loa versions |
| `.claude/protocols/` | Updated to latest Loa versions |
| `.claude/scripts/` | Updated to latest Loa versions |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Standard merge (may conflict) |
| `PROCESS.md` | Standard merge (may conflict) |
| `app/` | **Auto-preserved** via Phase 5.3 collateral deletion safeguard |
| `grimoires/loa/prd.md` | **Auto-preserved** via Phase 5.3 collateral deletion safeguard |
| `grimoires/loa/sdd.md` | **Auto-preserved** via Phase 5.3 collateral deletion safeguard |
| `grimoires/loa/analytics/` | **Auto-preserved** via Phase 5.3 collateral deletion safeguard |
| All non-framework files | **Auto-preserved** via Phase 5.3 collateral deletion safeguard |
| `.github/workflows/` | **Auto-preserved** via `.gitattributes` + Phase 5.5 revert |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | **Auto-preserved** via `.gitattributes` (merge=ours) |
| `README.md` | **Auto-preserved** via `.gitattributes` (merge=ours) |

> **Note**: All non-framework files are protected by the Phase 5.3 collateral deletion safeguard (v1.3.0). README.md, CHANGELOG.md, and `.github/workflows/` files have additional protection via `.gitattributes` merge=ours and Phase 5.5 revert. The pre-flight check ensures the `merge.ours.driver` is configured.

## Conflict Resolution

### Framework Files (`.claude/`)

Recommend accepting upstream version:
```bash
git checkout --theirs {filename}
```

### Project Identity Files (`CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`)

These files define YOUR project, not the Loa framework. ALWAYS keep your version:
```bash
git checkout --ours CHANGELOG.md README.md
```

Never accept upstream versions of these files - they contain Loa's template content, not your project's history and documentation.

### Project Files

Manual resolution required:
1. Open file and find conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`)
2. Keep changes you want from both versions
3. Remove conflict markers
4. Save the file

### After Resolving

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: update Loa framework (conflicts resolved)"
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| "Uncommitted changes" | Dirty working tree | Commit or stash changes first |
| "Remote not configured" | Missing loa/upstream remote | Add remote with `git remote add` |
| "Fetch failed" | Network or auth error | Check connection and remote URL |
| "Already up to date" | No new commits | Nothing to update |
| "Branch not found" | Remote branch doesn't exist | Check available branches with `git branch -r \| grep loa/` |
| "Invalid branch name" | Branch contains invalid characters | Only use alphanumeric, dash, underscore, slash, dot |
| "State file corrupt" | Invalid JSON in branch-testing.json | State auto-cleared, continue normally |
| "Safeguard: restored N files" | Upstream cleanup deleted non-framework files | Normal — safeguard working as intended |

### Branch Testing Errors

**Branch not found on remote:**
```
Error: Branch 'feature/does-not-exist' not found on remote 'loa'
Available branches:
  loa/main
  loa/feature/constructs-multiselect
  loa/fix/label-handling

To list all remote branches: git branch -r | grep loa/
```

**Dirty working tree (with stash suggestion):**
```
Error: Your working tree has uncommitted changes.

Quick fix: git stash push -m "before testing loa branch"
After testing: git stash pop
```

## Next Steps After Update

- Review [Loa releases](https://github.com/0xHoneyJar/loa/releases) for new features and changes
- Check `CLAUDE.md` for new commands or workflow updates
