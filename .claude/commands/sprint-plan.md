# Sprint Plan

## Purpose

Create a comprehensive sprint plan based on PRD and SDD. Breaks down work into actionable tasks with acceptance criteria, priorities, and assignments.

## Invocation

```
/sprint-plan
/sprint-plan background
```

## Agent

Launches `planning-sprints` from `skills/planning-sprints/`.

See: `skills/planning-sprints/SKILL.md` for full workflow details.

## Prerequisites

- PRD created (`grimoires/loa/prd.md` exists)
- SDD created (`grimoires/loa/sdd.md` exists)

## Workflow

1. **Pre-flight**: Verify setup, PRD, and SDD exist
2. **Analysis**: Read PRD for requirements, SDD for architecture
3. **Breakdown**: Create sprint structure with actionable tasks
4. **Clarification**: Ask about team size, sprint duration, priorities
5. **Validation**: Confirm assumptions about capacity and scope
6. **Generation**: Create sprint plan at `grimoires/loa/sprint.md`
7. **Analytics**: Update usage metrics (THJ users only)

## Arguments

| Argument | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `background` | Run as subagent for parallel execution | No |

## Outputs

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `grimoires/loa/sprint.md` | Sprint plan with tasks |

## Sprint Plan Sections

The generated plan includes:
- Sprint Overview (goals, duration, team structure)
- Sprint Breakdown with:
  - Sprint number and goals
  - Tasks with clear descriptions
  - Acceptance criteria (specific, measurable)
  - Estimated effort/complexity
  - Developer assignments
  - Dependencies and prerequisites
  - Testing requirements
- MVP Definition and scope
- Feature prioritization rationale
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Success metrics per sprint
- Dependencies and blockers
- Buffer time for unknowns

## Task Format

Each task includes:
- Task ID and title
- Detailed description
- Acceptance criteria
- Estimated effort
- Assigned to
- Dependencies
- Testing requirements

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| "PRD not found" | Missing prd.md | Run `/plan-and-analyze` first |
| "SDD not found" | Missing sdd.md | Run `/architect` first |

## Planner Style

The planner will:
- Ask about team capacity and sprint duration
- Clarify MVP scope and feature priorities
- Present options for sequencing and dependencies
- Only generate plan when confident in breakdown

## Sprint Ledger Integration

When a Sprint Ledger exists (`grimoires/loa/ledger.json`):

1. **Registers Sprints**: Each sprint in the plan is registered with `add_sprint()`
2. **Global Numbering**: Sprints receive globally unique IDs across cycles
3. **Logging**: Shows "Registered sprint-1 as global sprint-N" for each sprint
4. **SDD Reference**: Updates the cycle's `sdd` field with `grimoires/loa/sdd.md`

### Example Output

```
Creating sprint plan...
Registered sprint-1 as global sprint-4
Registered sprint-2 as global sprint-5
Registered sprint-3 as global sprint-6
Sprint plan created with 3 sprints (global IDs: 4-6)
```

### Legacy Mode

Without a ledger, sprint-plan works exactly as before using local sprint numbers.

## Flatline Protocol Integration (v1.17.0)

After sprint plan generation completes, the Flatline Protocol may execute automatically for adversarial review.

### Automatic Trigger Conditions

The postlude runs if ALL conditions are met:
- `flatline_protocol.enabled: true` in `.loa.config.yaml`
- `flatline_protocol.auto_trigger: true` in `.loa.config.yaml`
- `flatline_protocol.phases.sprint: true` in `.loa.config.yaml`

### What Happens

1. **Knowledge Retrieval**: Searches local grimoires for relevant patterns
2. **Phase 1**: 4 parallel API calls reviewing sprint plan
3. **Phase 2**: Cross-scoring between models
4. **Consensus**: Identifies task gaps, missing acceptance criteria, estimation concerns
5. **Presentation**: Shows results with option to refine tasks

### Output

Results are saved to `grimoires/loa/a2a/flatline/sprint-review.json`

### Manual Alternative

If auto-trigger is disabled, run manually:
```bash
/flatline-review sprint
```

## Next Step

After sprint plan is complete:
```
/implement sprint-1
```

That's it. The implement command handles everything:
- **With Ledger**: Resolves sprint-1 to global ID, uses correct a2a directory
- **With beads_rust**: Automatically manages task lifecycle (br ready, update, close)
- **Without either**: Uses markdown-based tracking from sprint.md

**No manual `br` commands required.** The agent handles task state internally.

## beads_rust Integration

When beads_rust is installed, the agent will:
1. **Session Start**: `br sync --import-only` to import latest state
2. **Create Structure**: Use helper scripts for epic/task creation
3. **Session End**: `br sync --flush-only` before commit

**Protocol Reference**: See `.claude/protocols/beads-integration.md`
