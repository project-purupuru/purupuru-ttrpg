# PreToolUse:Bash Team Role Guard — Enforce Lead-Only Operations
# =============================================================================
# When LOA_TEAM_MEMBER is set (indicating a teammate context in Agent Teams
# mode), blocks patterns that are restricted to the team lead:
#   - beads (br) commands          → C-TEAM-002
#   - .run/ state file writes      → C-TEAM-003
#   - git commit/push              → C-TEAM-004
#   - .claude/ mutations           → C-TEAM-005
#
# When LOA_TEAM_MEMBER is unset or empty, this hook is a complete no-op.
# Single-agent mode is unaffected.
#
# IMPORTANT: No set -euo pipefail — this hook must never fail closed.
# A grep or jq failure must result in exit 0 (allow), not an error.
# Fail-open with logging is the standard pattern for inline security hooks.
# (cf. block-destructive-bash.sh, ModSecurity DetectionOnly mode)
#
# WHY fail-open: A safety hook that crashes must NOT block the agent from
# operating. Fail-closed would make jq/grep bugs into denial-of-service
# attacks against the agent.
#
# WHY ERE not PCRE: grep -E (Extended Regex) is POSIX and universally
# available. grep -P (PCRE) is a GNU extension not available on macOS/BSD.
