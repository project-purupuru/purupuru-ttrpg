// Operator + Gumi-curated quiz corpus · 8 questions × 3 hand-picked answers each.
// Per SDD r2 §3.2 + §4.1 · GET-chained quiz · HMAC-validated state per step.
//
// Per-question element selection (curated · NOT algorithmic):
//   Q1 · Fire · Water · Metal
//   Q2 · Earth · Fire · Water
//   Q3 · Wood · Fire · Earth
//   Q4 · Water · Wood · Metal
//   Q5 · Wood · Metal · Water
//   Q6 · Earth · Fire · Wood
//   Q7 · Earth · Metal · Water
//   Q8 · Wood · Fire · Metal
//
// Coverage (24 slots = 8 Qs × 3 answers):
//   Wood  · 5 (Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6, Q8)
//   Fire  · 5 (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q6, Q8)
//   Earth · 4 (Q2, Q3, Q6, Q7)
//   Metal · 5 (Q1, Q4, Q5, Q7, Q8)
//   Water · 5 (Q1, Q2, Q4, Q5, Q7)
// All 5 elements appear 4-5x across the quiz · stable archetype resolution
// without algorithmic element selection.
//
// Scoring (per bazi-resolver.ts):
//   Each answer = +1 to its element. Highest score wins. Tie-break: canonical
//   wuxing order WOOD > FIRE > EARTH > METAL > WATER (one definitive element ·
//   no blended results per operator decision 2026-05-08).
//
// FUTURE (deferred to v1+):
//   Bazi anchor · operator's note: "+1 to birth element before tallying".
//   Requires DOB input step ahead of Q1 + bazi calculator package · this
//   would tighten the bridge between the quiz signal and traditional bazi
//   reading. Not in v0 scope (no DOB collection in the GET-chain Blink today).
