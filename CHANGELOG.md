# Changelog

All notable changes to Loa will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.66.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- **cycle-051**: First-Class Construct Support — RFC #452 (#454)
  - **Construct Index** (L1): `construct-index-gen.sh` generates `.run/construct-index.yaml` from installed packs with capability aggregation, composition pre-computation, and `--validate` flag for schema integrity
  - **Name Resolution** (L2): `construct-resolve.sh` with 3-tier resolution (slug → name → command) and collision warnings. CLAUDE.md conditional instruction for agent-side activation
  - **Composition as Pipe** (L3): `compose` subcommand detects writes/reads path overlap between constructs. Honest messaging when no material chain exists
  - **Personal Operator OS** (L4): `archetype-resolver.sh` with activate/deactivate/status/greeting. User-defined modes in `.loa.config.yaml` mapping to construct compositions. Gate merging: most-restrictive-wins
  - **Ambient Protocol Presence** (L5): Opt-in session greeting showing constructs, compositions, entry points, open threads. Thread tracking in `.run/open-threads.jsonl` with 30-day auto-archive
  - 56 new tests across 7 suites (construct-index-gen, construct-resolve, archetype-resolver, ambient-greeting, open-threads, cross-platform-validation, construct-e2e)

### Fixed

- **constructs-install.sh**: Prefer local source clone over stale registry pack (#449, #453)
  - `find_local_source()` checks for `manifest.json` OR `construct.yaml` (previously construct.yaml only — most packs don't have it)
  - Freshness uses `find -newer` on any file (not just construct.yaml mtime — catches fixes in any file)
  - Staleness warning (stderr) when installed pack >7 days old
  - Configurable local search paths via `.loa.config.yaml`
  - 6 new tests

### Security

- Bridgebuilder two-pass review on both PRs
- Deep ecosystem review connecting to supply chain integrity patterns
- All findings addressed before merge

## [1.65.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- **cycle-049**: Upstream Platform Alignment — Claude Code Feature Adoption (#451)
  - `allowed-tools` restrictions on 13 read-only/analytical skills (principle of least privilege)
  - `context: fork` + `agent` type for 6 heavy skills (/ride, /audit, /bridgebuilder-review)
  - `name` and `description` metadata on 13 skills for Claude Code discoverability
  - Path-scoped `.claude/rules/` directory with 3 zone rule files (zone-system, zone-state, shell-conventions)
  - ADVISORY compliance hook prototype (`implement-gate.sh`) — warns on App Zone writes outside /implement
  - Model adapter backward-compat aliases (claude-opus-4-0, 4-1, 4.0, 4.1, 4-5)
  - Memory system ownership boundary (auto-memory vs observations.jsonl)
  - Agent Teams hook validation + ATK-011 mitigation (blocks unset LOA_TEAM_MEMBER)
- **cycle-050**: Multi-Model Permission Architecture — Ecosystem-Wide Governance Primitives (#451)
  - **Capability taxonomy**: Model-agnostic `capabilities:` field on all 25 skills with `schema_version: 1`, 8 capability categories, strict tokenized `execute_commands` grammar (no raw shell strings)
  - **Cost profiles**: `cost-profile:` field on all 25 skills (lightweight/moderate/heavy/unbounded) for Freeside conservation guard integration
  - **Rule lifecycle metadata**: `origin`, `version`, `enacted_by` on all `.claude/rules/` files (mirrors loa-dixie ConstraintOrigin pattern)
  - **Dual-mode compliance hook**: `implement-gate.sh` supports authoritative mode (platform-detected) + heuristic fallback with mode pinning and audit logging
  - **Feature detection**: `detect-platform-features.sh` for versioned capability handshake
  - **Mount conflict detection**: `mount-conflict-detect.sh` with CSS-specificity precedence (project > Loa > default), dry-run output, deterministic ordering
  - **Validation tooling**: `validate-skill-capabilities.sh` (--strict, --json, deny-all default) and `validate-rule-lifecycle.sh`
  - **Portable date conversion**: `_date_to_epoch()` in compat-lib.sh v1.1.0 (GNU/macOS/perl fallback)
  - **Permissions reference doc**: Complete taxonomy documentation with cross-repo integration guidance
  - 38 new tests across 7 test suites (skill-capabilities, rule-lifecycle, compliance-hook, mount-conflicts, model-adapter, agent-teams, integration)
  - Cross-repo integration issues: loa-hounfour#49, loa-freeside#138, loa-dixie#80

### Changed

- **Fail-closed defaults**: Unannotated skills get deny-all capabilities (inverted from fail-open, per Flatline SKP-001)
- **`capabilities: all` prohibited**: Must use explicit expanded maps (Flatline SKP-003)
- **Strict execute_commands grammar**: Tokenized command+args, no raw shell patterns (Flatline IMP-003/SKP-004)
- **Validation in --strict mode**: Warnings promoted to errors on CI (Flatline IMP-002)
- `compat-lib.sh` bumped to v1.1.0
- `implement-gate.sh` path normalization resolves absolute paths relative to PROJECT_ROOT

### Fixed

- `has_tool()` word-boundary matching prevents substring false positives (CRIT-1)
- `_date_to_epoch("")` rejects empty string instead of returning current time (CRIT-3)
- `validate-skill-capabilities.sh` counter bug in strict mode (CRIT-2)
- `.claude/rules/zone-state.md` missing `.ck/**` path (BB-049-002)
- Portable date conversion in implement-gate.sh (BB-049-001)

### Security

- Flatline 3-model review (Opus + GPT-5.3-codex + Gemini 2.5 Pro): 5 HIGH_CONSENSUS integrated, 15 BLOCKERS addressed
- Red Team: 5 attack scenarios analyzed, 0 confirmed vulnerabilities
- Security audit: APPROVED — no CRITICAL/HIGH findings
- ATK-011: Blocks `unset LOA_TEAM_MEMBER` and `env -u` privilege escalation in Agent Teams

## [1.38.0] — 2026-02-14 — Adversarial Hardening Release

### Why This Release

Six cycles of concurrent engineering since v1.33.1 — spanning autonomous excellence loops, agent-grounded documentation, safety infrastructure, generative adversarial security design, and CI pipeline fixes — consolidated into a single release. Covers cycles 005 through 012, 10 merged PRs, and the transition from manual bridge reviews to autonomous red team pipelines.

### Added

#### Flatline Red Team — Generative Adversarial Security Design (#317, Cycle 012)

Complete red team pipeline for adversarial security analysis of design documents:

- **Red Team Pipeline** (`red-team-pipeline.sh`): 5-phase pipeline (sanitize → attack generation → cross-validation → consensus → counter-design) with per-phase timing metrics, budget enforcement, and inter-model safety envelope
- **Scoring Engine** (`scoring-engine.sh`): Multi-model consensus scoring with 4 categories — CONFIRMED_ATTACK (both >700), THEORETICAL (one >700, other ≤700), CREATIVE_ONLY (neither >700), DEFENDED (with counter-design). Configurable thresholds via `.loa.config.yaml`
- **Model Adapter** (`red-team-model-adapter.sh`): Mock/live abstraction for multi-model invocation with `--role attacker|defender|evaluator`, `--budget`, `--timeout` flags. Mock mode loads fixtures, live mode reserved for Hounfour integration
- **Golden Set** (`red-team-golden-set.json`): 33-entry calibration corpus across all 4 consensus categories, 5 attacker profiles (external, insider, supply_chain, confused_deputy, automated), 5 attack surfaces, and 8 compositional vulnerability entries
- **Input Sanitizer** (`red-team-sanitizer.sh`): Multi-pass sanitization with UTF-8 normalization, secret scanning, injection pattern detection, and `--inter-model` lightweight mode for between-phase safety
- **Report Generator** (`red-team-report.sh`): Markdown report with executive summary, per-attack details, counter-designs, and metrics
- **Retention Policy** (`red-team-retention.sh`): Configurable retention with age/count-based cleanup
- **Attack Surfaces Registry** (`attack-surfaces.yaml`): 5 Loa-specific surfaces (agent-identity, token-gated-access, prompt-pipeline, config-as-code, multi-model-consensus) with graceful degradation for non-Loa projects
- **Model Permissions** (`model-permissions.yaml`): Per-model capability constraints for 5 models
- **Red Team Schema** (`red-team-result.schema.json`): JSON Schema for pipeline output validation
- **Fixtures**: 5 response fixtures (2 attacker, 2 evaluator, 1 defender) for end-to-end mock testing
- **`/red-team` Skill**: Command and skill registration with danger_level: high
- 45 tests (33 scoring engine + 7 sanitizer + 5 model adapter)
- 6 sprints (global 79-84), 3 bridge iterations achieving flatline (23 → 1.1 → 0.4)

#### Harness Engineering — Safety Hooks, Deny Rules, Token Optimization (#315, Cycle 011)

Production safety infrastructure for autonomous agent operation:

- **Safety Hooks**: PreToolUse:Bash hook (`block-destructive-bash.sh`) blocks `rm -rf`, `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean -f` with safer alternative suggestions
- **Deny Rules**: Template credential deny rules (SSH, AWS, Kube, GPG, npm, pypi, git, gh) with merge installer script (`install-deny-rules.sh`)
- **Stop Guard** (`run-mode-stop-guard.sh`): Stop hook detects active autonomous runs and injects context reminder
- **Audit Logger** (`mutation-logger.sh`): PostToolUse:Bash JSONL logger for mutating commands with 10MB auto-rotation
- **CLAUDE.md Optimization**: 757 → 244 lines (68% reduction), 3433 → 1554 words (55% reduction), 6 reference files extracted to `.claude/loa/reference/`
- **Invariant Linter** (`lint-invariants.sh`): 9 structural invariants validated mechanically — system zone integrity, managed headers, constraints sync, required files, hooks, safety hook tests, deny rules
- **Token Budget Measurement** (`measure-token-budget.sh`): Shows 71% of tokens are demand-loaded via skill invocation
- 45 safety hook tests + 13 linter self-tests

#### BUTTERFREEZONE — Agent-Grounded README Standard (#311, Cycle 009)

Machine-generated, provenance-tagged README with ground truth anchoring:

- **Generator** (`butterfreezone-gen.sh`, ~1230 lines): 3-tier input detection (reality files → static analysis → bootstrap), 8 section extractors with provenance tagging (CODE-FACTUAL, DERIVED, OPERATIONAL), advisory checksums (per-section SHA-256), word-count budget enforcement (3200 total, 800/section), security redaction, manual section preservation via sentinels, atomic writes with flock
- **Validator** (`butterfreezone-validate.sh`): 7 validation checks (existence, AGENT-CONTEXT, provenance, references, word budget, ground-truth-meta, freshness) with `--strict`/`--json`/`--quiet` modes
- **Bridge Integration**: BUTTERFREEZONE_GEN hook in bridge orchestrator FINALIZING phase (non-blocking)
- **`/butterfreezone` Skill**: danger_level: safe
- 3 lore glossary entries: butterfreezone, lobster, grounding-ritual
- 41 BATS tests (28 gen + 13 validate)

### Fixed

- **Flatline Model Validation** (#308): `validate_model()` rejects invalid model names (agent aliases like `reviewer`) before API calls with actionable error messages; timeout raised 60s → 120s for Opus; stderr captured to temp files instead of `/dev/null`; 2s stagger between review and skeptic waves to avoid rate-limit contention; 13 BATS tests
- **Bridgebuilder Filtering Gaps** (#313): 7 new `LOA_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS` entries (`evals/**`, `.run/**`, `.flatline/**`, `PROCESS.md`, `BUTTERFREEZONE.md`, `INSTALLATION.md`, `grimoires/**/NOTES.md`); new `isLoaSystemZone()` function demotes framework file security findings to tier2; `resolveRepoRoot()` with CLI > env > git auto-detect precedence; 332 tests passing
- **Post-Merge Pipeline** (#318): Added git identity config to GitHub Actions workflow (fixed `fatal: empty ident name` that caused all 7 post-merge runs to fail); extended cycle classification regex to match `feat(cycle-...)` commits; fixed Discord webhook secret name to match repo configuration (`MELANGE_DISCORD_WEBHOOK`)

## [1.37.0] — DX Hardening (Cycle 008)

### Why This Release

Addresses three compounding DX pain points: eager secret resolution crashes config loading when unused providers lack env vars (#300), framework development artifacts pollute fresh user project mounts (#299), and review tools process system zone files alongside user code (#303).

### Added

- **Lazy Config Interpolation** (`interpolation.py`): `LazyValue` wrapper defers `{env:*}` resolution until `str()` access — missing env vars for unused providers no longer crash config load (FR-1, #300)
- **`_DEFAULT_LAZY_PATHS`**: Configurable set of dotted-key patterns (`providers.*.auth`) controlling which config paths get lazy treatment
- **Enhanced Error Messages**: `LazyValue.resolve()` includes provider name, agent context, and `/loa-credentials set` hint on failure
- **Mount Hygiene** (`mount-loa.sh`): `clean_grimoire_state()` removes framework development artifacts (prd.md, sdd.md, sprint.md, BEAUVOIR.md, SOUL.md) and stale a2a/archive contents after grimoire checkout (FR-3, #299)
- **Clean Ledger Init**: Mount now initializes empty `ledger.json` with zeroed counters instead of inheriting framework cycle data
- **NOTES.md Template**: Creates `## Learnings / ## Blockers / ## Observations` template if missing during mount
- **52 Python Tests**: 26 original + 26 new covering LazyValue, lazy path matching, lazy interpolation, lazy redaction
- **13 BATS Tests**: Mount hygiene — artifact removal, directory preservation, clean ledger, NOTES.md, context preservation, idempotency
- **Credential Provider Chain** (`credentials/providers.py`): Layered resolution — env vars → encrypted store → `.env.local` (FR-2, #300)
- **Encrypted Credential Store** (`credentials/store.py`): Fernet-encrypted `~/.loa/credentials/store.json.enc` with auto-generated key, 0600/0700 permissions, corrupt store recovery
- **Credential Health Checks** (`credentials/health.py`): HTTP validation against OpenAI, Anthropic, Moonshot endpoints with configurable timeouts
- **`/loa-credentials` Skill**: Interactive credential management — `status`, `set`, `test`, `delete` subcommands with `AskUserQuestion` for secure input
- **31 Credential Tests**: EnvProvider, DotenvProvider, CompositeProvider, EncryptedStore (conditional), EncryptedFileProvider, factory, health checks, interpolation integration
- **Review Scope Utility** (`review-scope.sh`): Shared script for zone detection + `.reviewignore` pattern matching — `detect_zones()`, `load_reviewignore()`, `is_excluded()`, `filter_files()` (FR-4, #303)
- **`.reviewignore` Template**: Gitignore-style review exclusion patterns — system zone, state zone, generated files, vendor deps
- **Mount `.reviewignore` Creation**: `create_reviewignore()` creates template during mount if not present
- **lib-content.sh Scope Integration**: `prepare_content()` excludes out-of-scope files before priority-based truncation
- **Bridgebuilder `.reviewignore` Support**: `loadReviewIgnore()` merges `.reviewignore` patterns with `LOA_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS` in truncation pipeline
- **Audit-Sprint Zone Awareness**: Security audit skill instructions updated to focus on app zone files with `.reviewignore` support
- **19 Review Scope BATS Tests**: Zone detection, `.reviewignore` parsing, glob/directory patterns, `--no-reviewignore` bypass, filter pipeline, combined filtering

### Changed

- `ProviderConfig.auth` type widened from `str` to `Any` to accept `LazyValue`
- `interpolate_config()` accepts `lazy_paths` and `_current_path` parameters
- `redact_config()` handles `LazyValue` without triggering resolution
- `redact_config_value()` uses duck-typing for `LazyValue` detection (no import needed)
- `interpolate_value()` resolves `{env:VAR}` through credential provider chain (env → encrypted → dotenv) instead of `os.environ` alone
- `loader.py` passes `lazy_paths=_DEFAULT_LAZY_PATHS` to interpolation pipeline

## [1.36.0] - 2026-02-13 — Post-Merge Automation Pipeline

### Why This Release

Automates the entire post-merge lifecycle: when a PR merges to main, a GitHub Actions workflow classifies the PR type (cycle/bugfix/other), computes the next semver from conventional commits, finalizes the CHANGELOG, creates tags and releases, and posts a summary. Cycle PRs get the full 8-phase pipeline via claude-code-action; bugfix/other PRs get lightweight tag-only processing. Closes #298.

### Added

- **Post-Merge Orchestrator** (`.claude/scripts/post-merge-orchestrator.sh`): 8-phase pipeline with atomic state updates, phase matrix, dry-run mode, and idempotent phases
- **Semver Bump Script** (`.claude/scripts/semver-bump.sh`): Conventional commit parser — feat→minor, fix→patch, BREAKING→major, outputs JSON
- **Release Notes Generator** (`.claude/scripts/release-notes-gen.sh`): CHANGELOG extraction with cycle/bugfix/other templates
- **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/post-merge.yml`): 4-job workflow (classify → simple-release/full-pipeline → notify)
- **claude-code-action Integration**: Sonnet model, 15 max turns, tool allowlist for cycle PRs
- **Shell-Only Fallback**: Pipeline runs without ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for cycle PRs
- **Discord Notification**: Webhook alert on pipeline failure
- **Post-Merge Config**: `post_merge:` section in `.loa.config.yaml`
- **Constraints**: C-MERGE-001 through C-MERGE-005 (orchestrator-only, no manual tags, RTFM non-blocking, idempotent phases, cycle-only full pipeline)
- **61 BATS Tests**: 22 semver + 15 release-notes + 24 orchestrator

## [1.35.1] - 2026-02-12 — Bridgebuilder Enrichment

### Why This Release

The Bridgebuilder Enrichment release (cycle-006, Issue #295) transforms automated bridge reviews from convergence-only checklists into educational experiences. The manual Bridgebuilder produces reviews that teach — FAANG parallels, metaphors, teachable moments. The automated bridge now supports the same richness through enriched findings schema, PRAISE severity, persona-driven review, and dual-stream output.

### Added

- **Bridgebuilder Persona** (`.claude/data/bridgebuilder-persona.md`): Identity, Voice (6 examples from manual reviews), Review Output Format (dual-stream), Content Policy (5 NEVER rules), PRAISE/Educational guidance, Token Budget
- **PRAISE Severity**: Weight 0, excluded from convergence score, celebrates good engineering decisions
- **Enriched Findings Fields**: `faang_parallel`, `metaphor`, `teachable_moment`, `connection`, `praise` in bridge-findings-parser.sh and JSON schema
- **JSON Fenced Block Parser**: Structured JSON inside `<!-- bridge-findings-start/end -->` markers with strict grammar enforcement (exit code 3 on violations)
- **Legacy Parser Fallback**: Backward-compatible regex parsing when no JSON fence detected
- **Atomic State Updates**: `flock`-based locking with write-to-temp + atomic `mv` for crash safety in bridge-state.sh
- **Content Redaction**: `redact_security_content()` with gitleaks-inspired patterns (AWS AKIA, GitHub ghp_/gho_/ghs_/ghr_, JWT eyJ, generic secrets) and allowlist
- **Post-Redaction Safety Check**: Blocks PR comment posting if secret prefixes remain after redaction
- **Size Enforcement**: 65KB truncation preserving findings JSON, 256KB findings-only fallback
- **Phase 3.1 Enriched Review Workflow**: 10-step process in SKILL.md (integrity check, validation, lore load, embody persona, dual-stream, save, size check, redact, safety check, parse+post)
- **Enrichment Metrics**: Per-iteration tracking of persona_loaded, findings_format, field_fill_rates, praise_count, insights_size_bytes, redactions_applied
- **Constraints**: C-BRIDGE-006 (ALWAYS load persona), C-BRIDGE-007 (SHOULD praise quality), C-BRIDGE-008 (SHOULD educational fields)
- **Configuration**: `run_bridge.bridgebuilder` section with persona, size, redaction settings
- **Formal JSON Schema**: `tests/fixtures/bridge-findings.schema.json` with all severity levels and enriched fields
- **Test Fixtures**: `enriched-bridge-review.md` (5 findings, PRAISE, full enrichment) and `legacy-bridge-review.md` (4 findings, markdown format)
- **99 BATS Tests**: 31 parser + 42 state + 26 trail covering JSON extraction, enriched fields, PRAISE, strict grammar, flock, crash safety, redaction, size enforcement, post-redaction safety

### Changed

- **bridge-findings-parser.sh**: Rewritten v2.0.0 — JSON extraction with legacy fallback, strict grammar, PRAISE in SEVERITY_WEIGHTS
- **bridge-state.sh**: Rewritten v2.0.0 — `atomic_state_update()` wrapping all RMW functions, enrichment metrics in iteration template
- **bridge-github-trail.sh**: Updated v2.0.0 — redaction, size enforcement, post-redaction safety, retention cleanup, printf fixes

## [1.35.0] - 2026-02-12 — Bridge Release

### Why This Release

The Run Bridge release (cycle-005, Issue #292) delivers autonomous excellence loops — iterative sprint-plan, Bridgebuilder review, findings parsing, and vision capture cycles that terminate via kaironic flatline detection. Built across 3 sprints: foundation data infrastructure (lore KB, vision registry, grounded truth), bridge core engine (orchestrator, state machine, findings parser), and full integration (GitHub trail, skill registration, golden path detection).

### Added

#### Run Bridge — Autonomous Excellence Loop (`/run-bridge`)

Complete iterative improvement system with 6 new scripts:

- **Bridge Orchestrator** (`bridge-orchestrator.sh`): State machine (PREFLIGHT→JACK_IN→ITERATING→FINALIZING→JACKED_OUT) with SIGNAL protocol for agent delegation, configurable depth (1-5), per-sprint mode, resume support, circuit breakers
- **Bridge State Manager** (`bridge-state.sh`): JSON state management with atomic writes, transition validation, iteration tracking, metrics accumulation
- **Bridge Findings Parser** (`bridge-findings-parser.sh`): Extracts structured JSON from Bridgebuilder markdown between `<!-- bridge-findings-start/end -->` markers. Severity weights: CRITICAL=10, HIGH=5, MEDIUM=2, LOW=1, VISION=0
- **Flatline Detection**: Kaironic termination — loop stops when severity score drops below threshold (default 5%) for consecutive iterations (default 2)
- **Vision Capture** (`bridge-vision-capture.sh`): Filters VISION findings, creates numbered entries, updates registry index
- **GitHub Trail** (`bridge-github-trail.sh`): PR comments with dedup markers, PR body summary tables, vision link posting. Graceful degradation when `gh` unavailable

#### `/run-bridge` Command and Skill

- **Command**: `.claude/commands/run-bridge.md` with `--depth`, `--per-sprint`, `--resume`, `--from` flags
- **Skill registration**: `.claude/skills/run-bridge/` with index.yaml (danger_level: high) and SKILL.md
- **Configuration**: `run_bridge:` section in `.loa.config.yaml` with defaults, timeouts, GitHub trail, GT, vision registry, RTFM, and lore settings

#### Mibera Lore Knowledge Base (`.claude/data/lore/`)

Cultural and philosophical context for agent skills, structured as YAML entries with `short` (inline) and `context` (teaching) fields:

- **Mibera core entries**: kaironic time, cheval, network mysticism, techno-animism, hounfour, loa rides
- **Mibera cosmology**: Milady/Mibera duality, BGT triskelion, Honey/Bera, the Jar
- **Mibera rituals**: bridge loop, sprint ceremony, mounting, jacking in, flatline ceremony, vision capture
- **Mibera glossary**: 15 term definitions for agent consumption
- **Neuromancer concepts**: ICE, jacking in, cyberspace, the matrix, SimStim, flatline construct, Wintermute, Neuromancer AI
- **Neuromancer mappings**: 9 concept-to-Loa-feature mappings
- **Integration guide**: README.md with entry schema and skill integration patterns

#### Vision Registry (`grimoires/loa/visions/`)

Directory structure for capturing VISION-type findings from bridge iterations:

- **index.md**: Status summary with table headers (ID, Title, Source, Status, Tags)
- **entries/**: Directory for individual vision entry files

#### Grounded Truth Generator (`.claude/scripts/ground-truth-gen.sh`)

Shell script handling mechanical GT operations:

- **Scaffold mode**: Creates hub-and-spoke directory structure (index.md, api-surface.md, architecture.md, contracts.md, behaviors.md)
- **Checksums mode**: Computes SHA-256 of source files referenced in reality/ extraction
- **Validate mode**: Token budget validation (index < 500, sections < 2000 tokens)
- **Cross-platform**: BSD/GNU sha256sum compatibility

#### `/ride` Ground Truth Extension (Phase 11)

- **`--ground-truth` flag**: Generates Grounded Truth output after ride
- **`--non-interactive` flag**: Skips phases 1, 3, 8 for autonomous bridge loop usage
- **Phase 11**: Read reality/ → synthesize GT files → generate checksums → validate tokens
- **riding-codebase SKILL.md**: Phase 11 documentation with token budgets and trajectory logging

#### Bridgebuilder Lore-Aware Persona

- **BEAUVOIR.md**: Lore Integration section with circuit breaker→kaironic-time, multi-model→hounfour, session recovery→cheval mappings
- **Structured Findings Format**: Documented `<!-- bridge-findings-start/end -->` marker protocol with severity tags and VISION type

#### Golden Path Bridge State Detection

- **`golden_detect_bridge_state()`**: Reads `.run/bridge-state.json`, returns state or "none"
- **`golden_bridge_progress()`**: Human-readable progress for `/loa` display (iteration N/depth, score, resume instructions)

#### Lore Integration Across Skills

- **Bridgebuilder** (`BEAUVOIR.md`): Teaching moments with lore references
- **Discovering Requirements** (`SKILL.md`): Philosophical framing for PRD creation
- **Golden Path / `/loa`** (`loa.md`): Naming context from glossary entries

#### Constraints

5 new bridge constraints (C-BRIDGE-001 through C-BRIDGE-005):
- Use `/run sprint-plan` within bridge iterations
- Post Bridgebuilder review as PR comment after each iteration
- Ensure GT claims cite `file:line` references
- Use YAML format for lore entries with required schema fields
- Include source bridge iteration and PR in vision entries

#### Tests

- **bridge-state.bats**: 21 tests (init, transitions, illegal transitions, flatline, metrics, schema)
- **bridge-findings-parser.bats**: 9 tests (parsing, severity weighting, edge cases)
- **bridge-vision-capture.bats**: 6 tests (entry creation, 0 visions, error handling)
- **bridge-github-trail.bats**: 10 tests (subcommands, arg validation, graceful degradation)
- **bridge-golden-path.bats**: 11 tests (state detection, progress display, regression)
- **lore-validation.bats**: 25 tests (YAML schema, cross-references, glossary count)
- **ground-truth-gen.bats**: 11 tests (scaffold, checksums, validate, all modes)
- **7 eval tasks**: lore-index-valid, lore-entries-schema, gt-checksums-match, bridge-state-schema-valid, bridge-findings-parser-works, golden-path-bridge-detection, vision-entries-traceability

## [1.34.1] - 2026-02-12

### Why This Release

Quality hardening pass for the Onboarding UX release. Fixes CI failures, adds missing test coverage, formalizes schemas, and documents lifecycle protocols — all traced to Bridgebuilder architectural review findings on PR #291.

### Fixed

- **Template Protection CI** — removed 37 forbidden state files (`.run/`, `.beads/`, `.ck/`) from git tracking that accumulated during previous development cycles
- **Fixture sync CI integration** — new `fixture-sync` CI job runs `sync-fixtures.sh --check` on every PR to catch drift before merge

### Added

- **Bug-specific journey bar** — `golden_format_bug_journey()` renders bug lifecycle visualization: `/triage ━━━ /fix ●━━━ /review ━━━ /close`
- **JSON output mode** — `golden_menu_options --json` produces machine-readable output for tooling integration
- **Archetype risk seeding** — `/plan` now seeds `NOTES.md ## Known Risks` from selected archetype's `context.risks`
- **Archetype schema validation** — `schema.yaml` defines required archetype fields; `sync-fixtures.sh --check` validates all archetypes
- **Auto-discovery of sync targets** — `sync-fixtures.sh` scans eval task YAML files to auto-populate fixture sync map
- **BATS unit test suite** — 33 tests covering `golden-path.sh` state detection, menu options, journey visualization, pipe sanitization, and bug transitions
- **Sprint completion protocol** — `.claude/protocols/sprint-completion.md` documents the implement → review → audit → COMPLETED lifecycle
- **Bug lifecycle protocol** — `.claude/protocols/bug-lifecycle.md` documents the full bug state machine with transitions and TOCTOU-safe verification
- 2 new framework eval tasks: `golden-bug-journey`, `golden-menu-json`

## [1.34.0] - 2026-02-12

### Why This Release

The Onboarding UX release makes Loa dramatically easier to get started with. Inspired by competitive analysis of Hive's onboarding (PR #290), this release adds **context-aware navigation**, **post-mount verification**, a **setup wizard**, and **project archetypes** — reducing first-5-minutes friction while keeping all power-user truename commands intact.

### Added

#### Context-Aware `/loa` Menu (FR-1, Sprint 8)

The `/loa` command now shows a dynamic, state-aware action menu instead of a static 3-option list:

- **9-state detection engine** (`golden_detect_workflow_state()`) — determines where you are in the workflow
- **Context-specific menu options** — each state shows relevant next actions (e.g., "Build sprint-2" when implementing, "Fix bug: title" when triaging)
- **Smart routing** — menu selections invoke the correct skill automatically
- **Destructive action safety** — "Plan new cycle" requires confirmation before archiving
- 3 new framework eval tasks (golden-menu-*)

#### Post-Mount Verification (FR-2, Sprint 9)

`mount-loa.sh` now validates the installation after framework sync:

- **`verify_mount()`** — checks framework files, config, deps, optional tools, and API key presence
- **NFR-8 compliance** — API key check is boolean-only ("is set" / "not set"), zero key material in output
- **Safe JSON assembly** — uses `jq -n --arg` instead of string concatenation (Flatline SKP-004)
- **Flags**: `--quiet`, `--json`, `--strict` (converts warnings to failures)
- **Exit codes**: 0 = success+warnings, 1 = failure
- 2 new framework eval tasks (mount-verify-*)

#### Setup Wizard `/loa setup` (FR-3, Sprint 10)

New interactive environment setup command:

- **`loa-setup-check.sh`** — JSONL validation engine checking API key, deps, optional tools, config
- **4-step wizard** — validate deps → check tools → show config → toggle features
- **`--check` flag** — non-interactive validation-only mode
- **Feature toggle UI** — AskUserQuestion with multiSelect for Flatline, Memory, Enhancement

#### Project Archetypes (FR-4, Sprint 10)

First-time `/plan` users now see a project archetype menu:

- **4 templates**: REST API, CLI Tool, Library/Package, Full-Stack App
- **Each template** provides vision, technical context, NFRs, testing strategy, and risks
- **"Other" option** skips to blank-slate interview
- **Auto-ingestion** — selected archetype written to `grimoires/loa/context/archetype.md`
- 2 new framework eval tasks (setup-check-nfr8, archetype-schema)

#### Use-Case Qualification (FR-5, Sprint 11)

First-time `/plan` users see a brief "Loa works best for..." guidance screen:

- Shows feature comparison ("What does Loa add?")
- Never blocks — always allows continuing
- Helps users self-qualify before investing in full planning

#### Auto-Format Construct Pack Spec (FR-6, Sprint 11)

Design specification for a construct pack that installs language-specific formatting hooks:

- Supports Python (ruff), JS/TS (prettier), Go (gofmt), Rust (rustfmt)
- Non-destructive — preserves existing formatter configs
- Implementation ships separately in `loa-constructs` repo

### Framework Eval Suite

- **30 tasks** (up from 23), 0 failures
- New coverage: golden-menu-*, mount-verify-*, setup-check-*, archetype-*

---

## [1.33.1] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed

#### Update Safety — Workflow File Propagation (#288)

`/update-loa` no longer propagates `.github/workflows/` files to downstream projects:

- **`.gitattributes`**: Added `merge=ours` rules for `.github/workflows/*.yml` and `.yaml` — prevents upstream workflow files from overwriting downstream versions during `git merge loa/main`
- **`/update-loa` Phase 5.5**: New post-merge revert step detects and removes workflow files added by upstream (handles new files that `merge=ours` cannot protect)
- **Eval**: Added `gitattributes-workflow-protection` framework test (23 total), updated fixture and baseline

**Root cause**: v1.33.0 introduced `.github/workflows/eval.yml` which propagated to downstream projects. GitHub requires the `workflow` OAuth scope to push workflow changes, blocking users without that scope.

---

## [1.33.0] - 2026-02-11 — Garde Release

### Why This Release

The Garde Release builds protective infrastructure around Loa's development lifecycle. A full **eval sandbox** lands with deterministic framework testing, 9 code-based graders, CI pipeline with dual-checkout trust boundaries, and baseline regression detection. Alongside this, **bug mode** (`/bug`) introduces a lightweight triage-to-fix workflow that enforces test-first development while bypassing PRD/SDD gates for observed failures. **6 PRs** covering eval infrastructure, bug-fixing workflows, and RTFM-surfaced documentation repairs.

### Added

#### Eval Sandbox — Framework Evals, Regression Suite, CI Pipeline (#277, #282)

Full evaluation infrastructure for deterministic framework testing:

- **7-script harness pipeline**: `run-eval.sh` orchestrator, `validate-task.sh`, `sandbox.sh`, `grade.sh`, `compare.sh`, `report.sh`, `pr-comment.sh`
- **9 code-based graders**: `file-exists`, `tests-pass`, `function-exported`, `pattern-match`, `diff-compare`, `quality-gate`, `no-secrets`, `constraint-enforced`, `skill-index-validator`
- **Framework correctness suite**: 22 deterministic tasks covering config validation, constraint enforcement, golden path structure, quality gates
- **Regression suite scaffold**: 11 agent-simulated tasks — bug triage, implementation, and review scenarios with 3 trials per task
- **5 test fixtures**: `loa-skill-dir`, `hello-world-ts`, `buggy-auth-ts`, `simple-python`, `shell-scripts`
- **GitHub Actions CI pipeline**: dual-checkout trust model (base=trusted graders, PR=untrusted tasks), source-injection scanning, symlink escape prevention, PR comment reports with collapsible results
- **Dockerfile.sandbox**: container isolation with yq, jq, git, bash 4.0+
- **Baseline comparison**: Wilson confidence intervals, regression/improvement/new/missing classification
- **`/eval` command**: skill registration for running suites from Claude Code
- 61 unit + integration tests across harness and graders

#### Bug Mode — Lightweight Bug-Fixing Workflow (#278, #279)

New `/bug` command and `bug-triaging` skill for observed-failure triage:

- **5-phase triage**: dependency check → eligibility validation → hybrid interview → codebase analysis → micro-sprint creation
- **Eligibility scoring**: 2-3 point rubric with disqualifiers for feature requests
- **PII redaction**: API keys, JWT tokens, passwords, emails stripped from imported content
- **GitHub issue import**: `--from-issue N` flag for automated intake
- **Test-first enforcement**: HALTs if no test infrastructure detected
- **Run mode integration**: `/run --bug "description"` with circuit breaker
- **Golden path awareness**: `/build` auto-detects active bugs and routes correctly
- **State management**: bug state tracking in `.run/bugs/{id}/state.json` with TOCTOU-safe detection
- **Process compliance**: C-PROC-015 (validate eligibility) and C-PROC-016 (no feature work via `/bug`)

### Changed

- Process compliance tables in CLAUDE.loa.md updated to include `/bug` as valid implementation path
- `/loa` status command extended to detect and report active bug workflows
- Run mode SKILL.md updated with `/run --bug` documentation

### Fixed

- **CI trust boundary false positives**: refactored globstar save/restore in `run-eval.sh` to avoid `eval` command; test directories excluded from trust boundary scanner (#283)
- **Fixture config tracking**: `.gitignore` negation for `evals/fixtures/**/.loa.config.yaml` — global ignore rule caused 3 framework task failures (#284)
- **PR comment coverage**: workflow step now posts results for ALL suites, not just most recent run directory (#284)
- **README documentation gaps**: added "What Is This?" definition, clarified slash commands vs shell commands, added prerequisites, post-install verification, first-run expectations, and beads_rust requirement clarification
- **INSTALLATION documentation gaps**: moved optional enhancements after core install, fixed config bootstrap path, added minimal working config example, clarified `.beads/` creation timing, resolved beads_rust requirement contradiction, added uninstall section, added failure recovery guidance

### Documentation

- **Eval CI pipeline guide**: trust model, dual-checkout architecture, pipeline steps, suite types, artifact retention (#285)
- **Eval health checks**: local verification commands, task category reference, monitoring recommendations (#285)
- **Eval operational runbook**: adding tasks/graders/fixtures, investigating CI failures, baseline update procedures (#285)

## [1.32.0] - 2026-02-10 — Hounfour Release

### Why This Release

The Hounfour Release extracts multi-model provider infrastructure from loa-finn into upstream Loa as the `loa_cheval` Python package — a full provider abstraction layer with Anthropic + OpenAI adapters, cost metering, routing chains, and circuit breakers. Alongside this headline feature, Bridgebuilder v2.1 lands with typed errors, glob matching, incremental review, and persona routing, while `/rtfm` introduces zero-context documentation quality testing. **15 PRs** covering provider infrastructure, skill polish, documentation tooling, and template hygiene.

## [1.31.0] - 2026-02-07 — Bridgebuilder Release

### Why This Release

This is the largest Loa release to date — **27 PRs** spanning developer experience, security hardening, cross-model adversarial review, and a complete documentation overhaul. The headline: **Golden Path** gives 90% of users 5 zero-arg commands, while **Adversarial Flatline Dissent** adds cross-model challenge to code review and security audit.

The README and INSTALLATION.md have been rewritten with input from the Bridgebuilder persona — optimized for both human onboarding and AI agent consumption.

### Added

#### Golden Path — 5 Commands for 90% of Users (#219)

Five zero-argument porcelain commands wrapping the full truename workflow:

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/loa` | Where am I? What's next? |
| `/plan` | Requirements → Architecture → Sprints |
| `/build` | Build the current sprint |
| `/review` | Code review + security audit |
| `/ship` | Deploy and archive |

Design follows the git porcelain/plumbing model — Golden Path for most users, truenames for power users.

#### Error Code Registry & `/loa doctor` (#218)

Structured error codes (LOA-E001+) with human-readable explanations and fix suggestions. `/loa doctor` provides comprehensive system health diagnostics with CI-friendly JSON output.

#### Adversarial Flatline Dissent (#235)

Cross-model adversarial challenge during code review and security audit. GPT-5.2-Codex acts as independent dissenter against Claude's findings with:
- Priority-based diff truncation with P0-P3 file classification
- Context escalation for security-critical files
- Secret scanning with configurable allowlists
- Anchor validation and severity demotion for ungrounded findings
- Budget pre-check to prevent runaway API costs
- Graceful degradation on API failure

#### GPT Review: System Zone Detection & Priority Truncation (#233)

GPT review now detects `.claude/` system zone modifications and applies priority-based diff truncation to stay within token limits while ensuring security-critical files are always reviewed first.

#### Cross-Repo Pattern Extraction (#227)

25 reusable shell patterns extracted into 5 library modules:
- `lib-validate.sh` — Input validation, path safety, schema checking
- `lib-log.sh` — Structured logging with levels and JSON output
- `lib-config.sh` — YAML config loading with defaults
- `lib-git.sh` — Git operations, branch detection, upstream safety
- `lib-io.sh` — File I/O, atomic writes, temp file management

#### DRY Constraint Registry (#225)

Single-source constraint definitions in `.claude/data/constraints.json` with generated CLAUDE.md tables. Eliminates constraint drift between documentation and enforcement.

#### Portable Persistence Framework (#220)

WAL-based key-value persistence for shell scripts with pluggable backends and circuit breakers.

#### Cross-Platform Shell Scripting Protocol (#210)

Portable compatibility layer handling macOS vs Linux differences (BSD date, sed, stat, mktemp). Eliminates `%N` nanosecond and other platform-specific failures.

#### Construct Manifest Standard (#213)

Standardized manifest format for Loa Constructs with event-driven contracts, tool dependency declarations, and JSON schema validation.

#### MLP-Informed Beads Enhancements (#209)

Beads enhanced with gap detection, lineage tracking, task classification, and context compilation — informed by Machine Learning Pipeline (MLP) patterns.

#### Opus 4.6 & GPT-5.3-Codex Model Support (#202)

Model registry updated with Claude Opus 4.6 and GPT-5.3-Codex pricing and capabilities.

#### Run Mode `--local` Flag (#201)

`--local` flag for run mode to skip git push. Configurable via `auto_push` setting for offline or local-only workflows.

#### Beads TypeScript Runtime Patterns (#191)

TypeScript patterns for beads_rust integration in application code.

#### CODEOWNERS (#206)

Added `.github/CODEOWNERS` for automatic PR review assignment.

### Changed

- Layered process enforcement prevents AI from bypassing implement/review/audit gates (#221)
- README.md rewritten: Golden Path prominent, value proposition section, agent-readable metadata, 17 skills listed, updated feature table
- INSTALLATION.md overhauled: TOC added, Claude Code install instructions, yq ambiguity fixed (mikefarah/yq only), `/loa doctor` verification step, beads-first language

### Fixed

- Event bus bash version guard for non-bash shell sourcing (#234)
- Beads-health.sh zero output and event-bus.sh flock detection (#231)
- Event bus hardened against jq injection, DLQ diagnostics improved (#215)
- Backward compatibility aliases for renamed scripts + Opus 4.6 sweep (#207)
- Heredoc corruption of `${...}` template literals in generated source files (#203, #200)
- macOS `date %N` incompatibility breaking Flatline Protocol (#199)
- Simstim Plan Mode hijacking orchestration workflows (#196)
- Constructs URL migration, multi-pack UI, and smart routing (#189)

### Security

- Critical and high findings from security audit remediated (#232)
- 56-finding comprehensive audit remediated — supply chain, secrets, injection, CI hardening (#212)

### Performance

- Beads isomorphic optimizations: WAL, batch queries, and circuit breaker (#205)

---

## [1.29.0] - 2026-02-05 — Beads-First Infrastructure

### Why This Release

This release implements **Beads-First Architecture** where task tracking via beads_rust is the EXPECTED DEFAULT, not an optional enhancement. Working without beads becomes ABNORMAL and requires explicit, time-limited acknowledgment.

*"We're building spaceships. Safety of operators and users is paramount."*

### Added

#### Beads-First Preflight (#182)

Comprehensive health check infrastructure for beads_rust:

```bash
# Check beads health
.claude/scripts/beads/beads-health.sh --json

# Manage state
.claude/scripts/beads/update-beads-state.sh --health HEALTHY
.claude/scripts/beads/update-beads-state.sh --opt-out "Reason"
```

**New Files**:
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `beads-health.sh` | Comprehensive health check (6 exit codes) |
| `update-beads-state.sh` | State file management |
| `beads-preflight.md` | Protocol documentation |
| `test_beads_health.sh` | Unit tests |

**Health Check Exit Codes**:
| Code | Status | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| 0 | HEALTHY | All checks pass |
| 1 | NOT_INSTALLED | br binary not found |
| 2 | NOT_INITIALIZED | No .beads directory |
| 3 | MIGRATION_NEEDED | Schema incompatible |
| 4 | DEGRADED | Partial functionality |
| 5 | UNHEALTHY | Critical issues |

#### Autonomous Mode Beads Gate

Autonomous mode (`/run`) now REQUIRES beads by default:

```bash
# Will HALT if beads unavailable
/run sprint-1

# Override (not recommended)
export LOA_BEADS_AUTONOMOUS_OVERRIDE=true
```

**Configuration**:
```yaml
beads:
  mode: recommended  # required | recommended | disabled
  autonomous:
    requires_beads: true
```

#### Opt-Out Workflow

Time-limited acknowledgment for working without beads:

- 24h expiry (configurable)
- Requires reason (configurable)
- Re-prompts when expired
- Logs to trajectory for auditability

### Changed

- Updated `/sprint-plan` with Phase -1 beads preflight
- Updated `/implement` with Phase -2 beads sync
- Updated `/simstim` Phase 0 with beads check
- Updated `/run` preflight with autonomous beads gate
- Added beads configuration section to `.loa.config.yaml.example`
- Updated `CLAUDE.loa.md` with Beads-First documentation

### Migration Notes

**For existing users without beads_rust installed**:

1. Install beads_rust: `cargo install beads_rust`
2. Initialize: `br init`
3. Workflows will prompt if beads unavailable (not a hard block in interactive mode)

**For autonomous/run mode**:
- If you run autonomous mode without beads, add `beads.autonomous.requires_beads: false` to your config
- Consider installing beads for better state persistence across context windows

## [1.28.0] - 2026-02-05 — Dicklesworth Improvements

### Why This Release

This release adds three major features inspired by the Dicklesworthstone ecosystem: **Post-Compact Recovery Hooks** for automatic context recovery after compaction, **Flatline Beads Loop** for iterative task graph refinement, and **Persistent Memory** for session-spanning observation storage.

*"Check your beads N times, implement once."*

### Added

#### Post-Compact Recovery Hooks (#178)

Automatic context recovery after Claude Code context compaction:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreCompact": [{"matcher": "", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": ".claude/hooks/pre-compact-marker.sh"}]}],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [{"matcher": "", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": ".claude/hooks/post-compact-reminder.sh"}]}]
  }
}
```

**New Files**:
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `pre-compact-marker.sh` | Captures state before compaction |
| `post-compact-reminder.sh` | Injects recovery reminder after compaction |
| `settings.hooks.json` | Hook registration template |
| `test_pcr_hooks.sh` | 13 unit tests |

**Features**:
- One-shot delivery (marker deleted after reminder)
- Captures run_mode, simstim, and skill state
- Logs compaction events to trajectory
- Project-local and global fallback markers

#### Flatline Beads Loop (#177)

Iterative multi-model refinement of task graphs:

```bash
.claude/scripts/beads-flatline-loop.sh --max-iterations 6 --threshold 5
```

**How It Works**:
1. Export beads to JSON
2. Run Flatline Protocol review on task graph
3. Apply HIGH_CONSENSUS suggestions automatically
4. Repeat until changes "flatline" (< 5% for 2 iterations)
5. Sync final state to git

**New Files**:
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `beads-flatline-loop.sh` | Main orchestrator script |
| `beads-review.md` | Flatline prompt for task graph review |
| `test_blf.sh` | 16 unit tests |

**Simstim Integration**: New Phase 6.5 "FLATLINE_BEADS" runs automatically after PLANNING when beads_rust is installed.

#### Persistent Memory (#175)

Session-spanning observation storage with progressive disclosure:

```bash
# Token-efficient index (~50 tokens per entry)
.claude/scripts/memory-query.sh --index

# Full details (~500 tokens)
.claude/scripts/memory-query.sh --full obs-1234567890-abc123
```

**New Files**:
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `memory-writer.sh` | Hook for capturing observations |
| `memory-query.sh` | Query interface with progressive disclosure |
| `test_memory.sh` | 19 unit tests |

**Features**:
- Learning signal detection (discovered, learned, fixed, resolved, pattern, insight)
- Privacy filtering (redacts `<private>` tagged content)
- Session-specific logging
- Retention limits with automatic archiving

### Changed

- Updated `flatline-orchestrator.sh` to support `--phase beads`
- Updated `simstim.md` with Phase 6.5 documentation
- Updated `planning-sprints/SKILL.md` with Beads Flatline Loop section
- Added memory configuration section to `.loa.config.yaml.example`

### Tests

| Test Suite | Tests | Status |
|------------|-------|--------|
| PCR Hooks | 13 | ✅ All passing |
| BLF | 16 | ✅ All passing |
| Memory | 19 | ✅ All passing |
| **Total** | **48** | ✅ All passing |

---

## [1.27.0] - 2026-02-04 — Configurable Paths & Trace-Based Routing

### Why This Release

This release introduces **configurable grimoire paths** for flexible workspace layouts (e.g., OpenClaw integration) and **feedback trace-based routing** for intelligent issue classification. Also includes critical stability fixes for run-mode and simstim state synchronization.

*"Configure your paths, trace your feedback."*

### Added

#### Configurable Grimoires Location (#176, #173)

Grimoire and state file locations are now configurable for integration scenarios:

```yaml
paths:
  grimoire: grimoires/loa          # Default
  beads: .beads
  soul:
    source: grimoires/loa/BEAUVOIR.md
    output: grimoires/loa/SOUL.md
```

**OpenClaw Integration Example**:
```yaml
paths:
  grimoire: .loa/grimoire
  soul:
    source: .loa/grimoire/BEAUVOIR.md
    output: SOUL.md    # At workspace root
```

**New Files**:
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `bootstrap.sh` | PROJECT_ROOT detection (3 fallback strategies) |
| `path-lib.sh` | 16 getter functions for path resolution |
| `test_path_lib.sh` | 16 unit tests |
| `test_configurable_paths.sh` | 10 integration tests |

**Rollback Safety**:
- `LOA_USE_LEGACY_PATHS=1` bypasses config, uses hardcoded defaults
- CI lint check (warning mode) prevents path regression
- Environment overrides: `LOA_GRIMOIRE_DIR`, `LOA_BEADS_DIR`, `LOA_SOUL_SOURCE`, `LOA_SOUL_OUTPUT`

**Requirements**: yq v4+ (mikefarah/yq). Missing yq uses defaults with warning.

#### Feedback Trace-Based Routing (#174, #171)

Intelligent `/feedback` routing based on execution trajectory analysis:

```yaml
feedback:
  trace_routing:
    enabled: true  # Disabled by default
```

**Classification Categories**:
| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `skill_bug` | Bug in existing skill |
| `skill_gap` | Missing feature in skill |
| `missing_skill` | Need new skill |
| `runtime_bug` | Framework/runtime issue |

**Implementation**:
- `trace_analyzer` Python package with hybrid matching (keyword + fuzzy + embeddings)
- Privacy-first: default-deny PII redaction
- 80 unit tests passing
- Disabled by default pending classifier tuning

#### Two-Pass Security Analysis (#163)

Enhanced `/audit` with structured taint analysis methodology:

**New Phases**:
| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 0.5 (Scope) | Count files by security category |
| 1A (Recon) | Source/sink identification with taxonomy |
| 1B (Investigate) | Taint path tracing with time budget |

**Detection Patterns**: SQL Injection, Command Injection, XSS, Path Traversal, SSRF, LLM Safety

### Fixed

#### Run-Mode State Preservation (#165)

- **Problem**: Context compaction caused `/run sprint-plan` to lose autonomous state
- **Solution**: Added run mode state recovery to CLAUDE.loa.md and session protocols
- Recovery checks `.run/sprint-plan-state.json` and resumes without confirmation

#### Simstim Run-Mode Sync (#172)

- **Problem**: Simstim state stuck in "RUNNING" after `/run sprint-plan` completed
- **Solution**: New `--sync-run-mode` command with plan ID correlation
- Added `--set-expected-plan-id` for pre-invocation correlation
- Auto-recovery on resume for completed-but-not-recorded scenarios

#### Constructs Skill Count (#168)

- Fixed jq query to read from `manifest.skills` array
- Packs now correctly display skill counts in `/constructs` browser

#### Flatline macOS Case-Sensitivity (#167)

- Fixed path comparison failure on case-insensitive filesystems
- Applied `realpath` fix to `flatline-orchestrator.sh`

## [1.26.0] - 2026-02-04 — Workspace Cleanup & Post-PR Validation

### Why This Release

This release introduces **workspace cleanup** for fresh development cycles and completes the **Post-PR Validation Loop** integration. Together, these features ensure both clean starting conditions and rigorous post-PR quality gates.

*"Archive the past, validate the future."*

### Added

#### Workspace Cleanup (#160)

Automated archiving of previous cycle artifacts during `/simstim` and `/autonomous` preflight:

```bash
# Interactive mode (default)
workspace-cleanup.sh                    # Prompt with 5s timeout

# Autonomous mode
workspace-cleanup.sh --yes --json       # Archive without prompt

# Preview mode
workspace-cleanup.sh --dry-run          # Show what would be archived
```

**4-Stage Archive Process**:
| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1. Copy | Copy files to staging directory |
| 2. Verify | SHA256 checksum verification |
| 3. Finalize | Rename staging to archive with manifest |
| 4. Remove | Delete originals (with transaction log) |

**Security Features**:
- Symlink rejection (no following)
- Path traversal prevention (`..` blocked)
- Absolute path rejection
- Realpath containment validation
- Writability and ownership checks

**Integration Points**:
- `simstim-orchestrator.sh` - Preflight cleanup (respects `--resume`, `--no-clean`)
- `autonomous-agent/SKILL.md` - Phase 0.0 with fail-closed policy

**Configuration** (`.loa.config.yaml`):
```yaml
workspace_cleanup:
  enabled: true
  default_action: archive
  retention:
    max_age_days: 90
    max_count: 10
  security:
    follow_symlinks: false
```

**Files**:
- `.claude/scripts/workspace-cleanup.sh` - Main script (~1100 lines)
- `.claude/scripts/tests/test-workspace-cleanup.bats` - 30 unit tests

#### Post-PR Validation Integration (#158, #159)

Complete post-PR validation loop with `/autonomous` integration:

**Workflow**:
```
PR_CREATED → POST_PR_AUDIT → CONTEXT_CLEAR → E2E_TESTING → FLATLINE_PR → READY_FOR_HITL
```

**Scripts**:
| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `post-pr-orchestrator.sh` | Main orchestrator with state machine |
| `post-pr-state.sh` | State management with locking |
| `post-pr-audit.sh` | PR audit with finding classification |
| `post-pr-e2e.sh` | E2E test runner with failure tracking |
| `post-pr-context-clear.sh` | Checkpoint writer for fresh context |

**Exit Codes**:
| Code | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| 0 | Success | READY_FOR_HITL |
| 1 | Invalid args | Error |
| 2 | Timeout | HALT |
| 3 | Phase failure | HALT |
| 4 | Flatline blocker | HALT |
| 5 | User interrupt | HALT |

**Configuration** (`.loa.config.yaml`):
```yaml
post_pr_validation:
  enabled: true
  phases:
    audit: { enabled: true, max_iterations: 5 }
    context_clear: { enabled: true }
    e2e: { enabled: true, max_iterations: 3 }
    flatline: { enabled: false }  # ~$1.50 cost
```

### Fixed

- **Empty array bug** in `workspace-cleanup.sh` - `validate_scanned_paths()` now correctly handles empty result arrays
- **Test assertions** - Fixed 6 failing tests in `test-workspace-cleanup.bats`
- **Unsafe command execution** in `post-pr-audit.sh` - Replaced `bash -c "$cmd"` with array-based execution

## [1.25.0] - 2026-02-03 — Post-PR Validation Loop

### Why This Release

This release introduces the **Post-PR Validation Loop**, an automated quality assurance process that runs after PR creation. It ensures code is thoroughly reviewed before human review begins.

*"Trust but verify—automatically."*

### Added

#### Post-PR Validation Command

```bash
# Full validation loop
.claude/scripts/post-pr-orchestrator.sh --pr-url <url>

# Dry run
.claude/scripts/post-pr-orchestrator.sh --dry-run --pr-url <url>

# Resume from checkpoint
.claude/scripts/post-pr-orchestrator.sh --resume --pr-url <url>
```

#### Validation Phases

| Phase | Description | Fix Loop |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| POST_PR_AUDIT | Security/quality audit | Yes (max 5) |
| CONTEXT_CLEAR | Save checkpoint, prompt `/clear` | No |
| E2E_TESTING | Fresh-eyes build & test | Yes (max 3) |
| FLATLINE_PR | Multi-model review (~$1.50) | No |

#### Circuit Breakers

- Same finding 3x → Audit escalation
- Same failure 2x → E2E escalation

#### Finding Identity Algorithm

Stable 16-char hash for deduplication:
```
SHA256(category|rule_id|file|normalized_line|severity)[:16]
```

Line normalization: ±5 tolerance (round to nearest 10)

## [1.23.0] - 2026-02-03 — Flatline-Enhanced Compound Learning

### Why This Release

This release connects the **Flatline Protocol** to the **Compound Learning** pipeline, enabling consensus-based learning extraction and validation.

*"When two models agree on a learning, promote it. When they disagree, investigate."*

### Added

#### Flatline → Learning Capture

HIGH_CONSENSUS insights from Flatline reviews become learning candidates:

```bash
# Extract learnings from Flatline results
.claude/scripts/flatline-learning-extractor.sh --results flatline-results.json

# Validate borderline learning
.claude/scripts/flatline-validate-learning.sh --learning learning.json --dry-run
```

#### 3-Layer Circular Prevention

Prevents Flatline from validating its own outputs:
| Layer | Check | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| L1 | `source: flatline` | Skip |
| L2 | Validation history | Skip if seen |
| L3 | Rate limit | 30s cooldown |

#### Semantic Similarity

Embedding-based duplicate detection before upstream proposal:
```bash
.claude/scripts/flatline-semantic-similarity.sh --learning learning.json --threshold 0.85
```

#### Pre-Proposal Review

Adversarial review of upstream proposals:
```bash
.claude/scripts/flatline-proposal-review.sh --proposal proposal.json
```

#### Rejection Pattern Analysis

Root cause tracking for rejected proposals:
```bash
.claude/scripts/flatline-rejection-analysis.sh --rejection rejection.json
```

#### New Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `flatline-learning-extractor.sh` | Extract learnings from HIGH_CONSENSUS |
| `flatline-validate-learning.sh` | Single-learning 2-model validator |
| `flatline-semantic-similarity.sh` | Embedding-based duplicate detection |
| `flatline-proposal-review.sh` | Pre-proposal adversarial review |
| `flatline-rejection-analysis.sh` | Root cause pattern tracking |
| `lib/api-resilience.sh` | API retry, circuit breaker, budget controls |

#### Consensus Mapping

| GPT Vote | Opus Vote | Consensus | Action |
|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| approve | approve | APPROVE | Promote |
| reject | reject | REJECT | Demote |
| mixed | - | DISPUTED | Human review |

### Configuration

```yaml
flatline_integration:
  learning_extraction:
    enabled: true
    source_marker: true
  validation:
    max_per_cycle: 10
    daily_budget: 50
  semantic_similarity:
    threshold: 0.85
    model: text-embedding-3-small
```

## [1.22.1] - 2026-02-03 — Constructs Skill Discovery Fix

### Fixed

#### Constructs Skill Symlinks (#153)

Fixed skill symlink location so Claude Code can discover installed pack skills:

**Before** (broken):
```
.claude/constructs/skills/observer/analyzing-gaps → ../../packs/observer/skills/analyzing-gaps
```

**After** (fixed):
```
.claude/skills/analyzing-gaps → ../constructs/packs/observer/skills/analyzing-gaps
```

- Skills now symlink directly to `.claude/skills/<skill>`
- Added collision detection for existing framework skills
- Uninstall correctly removes individual skill symlinks

## [1.24.0] - 2026-02-03 — Simstim HITL Workflow

### Why This Release

This release introduces the **Simstim** command (`/simstim`), a Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) accelerated development workflow that orchestrates the complete Loa development cycle with integrated Flatline Protocol reviews at each stage.

*"Experience the AI's work while maintaining your own consciousness."* — Gibson, Neuromancer

### Added

#### /simstim Command

Full-cycle orchestration from PRD to implementation:

```bash
/simstim                     # Full cycle: PRD → SDD → Sprint → Implementation
/simstim --from architect    # Skip PRD (already exists)
/simstim --from sprint-plan  # Skip PRD + SDD
/simstim --from run          # Skip planning, just run sprints
/simstim --resume            # Continue from interruption
/simstim --dry-run           # Preview planned phases
/simstim --abort             # Clean up state and exit
```

**8-Phase Workflow**:
| Phase | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | PREFLIGHT | Validate configuration, check state |
| 1 | DISCOVERY | Create PRD interactively |
| 2 | FLATLINE PRD | Multi-model review of PRD |
| 3 | ARCHITECTURE | Create SDD interactively |
| 4 | FLATLINE SDD | Multi-model review of SDD |
| 5 | PLANNING | Create sprint plan interactively |
| 6 | FLATLINE SPRINT | Multi-model review of sprint plan |
| 7 | IMPLEMENTATION | Autonomous execution via `/run sprint-plan` |
| 8 | COMPLETE | Summary and cleanup |

#### HITL Flatline Mode

New Flatline mode optimized for human operators:

| Category | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| HIGH_CONSENSUS | Both models >700 | Auto-integrate (no prompt) |
| DISPUTED | Score delta >300 | Present to user for decision |
| BLOCKER | Skeptic concern >700 | Present to user for decision (NOT auto-halt) |
| LOW_VALUE | Both <400 | Skip silently |

Key difference from `/autonomous`: BLOCKERs are shown to the human for decision instead of automatically halting the workflow.

#### State Management

Resume capability via `.run/simstim-state.json`:
- Tracks phase completion and artifact checksums
- Detects artifact drift on resume
- PID-based lockfile prevents concurrent execution

**Files**:
- `.claude/skills/simstim-workflow/SKILL.md` - Main orchestration skill
- `.claude/skills/simstim-workflow/index.yaml` - Skill metadata
- `.claude/commands/simstim.md` - User documentation
- `.claude/scripts/simstim-orchestrator.sh` - State and orchestration logic

**Configuration** (`.loa.config.yaml`):
```yaml
simstim:
  enabled: true
  flatline:
    auto_accept_high_consensus: true
    show_disputed: true
    show_blockers: true
    phases: [prd, sdd, sprint]
  defaults:
    timeout_hours: 24
```

---

## [1.22.0] - 2026-02-03 — Autonomous Flatline Integration

### Why This Release

This release enables the **Flatline Protocol** to operate within autonomous workflows (`/autonomous`, `/run sprint-plan`) without human intervention. HIGH_CONSENSUS findings auto-integrate, BLOCKERS halt the workflow with escalation reports, and DISPUTED items are logged for post-review.

*"Adversarial review at machine speed - consensus integrates, disputes escalate."*

### Added

#### Autonomous Mode Detection

Script: `.claude/scripts/flatline-mode-detect.sh`

Intelligent mode detection with strong vs weak signal distinction:

```bash
# Strong signals (trigger auto-enable)
CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN  # AI gateway authenticated
LOA_OPERATOR=ai         # Explicit AI operator

# Weak signals (require opt-in)
Non-TTY                 # Could be pipe or batch
CLAUDECODE              # Claude Code agent
CLAWDBOT_AGENT          # Clawdbot agent
```

**Mode Precedence**: CLI flags → Environment → Config → Auto-detect → Default (interactive)

#### Atomic Integration Pipeline

Safe document modification with rollback support:

```
lock → verify_hash → snapshot → integrate → release
```

**Scripts**:
- `.claude/scripts/flatline-lock.sh` - flock()-based advisory locking with NFS fallback
- `.claude/scripts/flatline-snapshot.sh` - Pre-integration snapshots with quota management
- `.claude/scripts/flatline-manifest.sh` - Run tracking with UUIDv4 IDs
- `.claude/scripts/flatline-rollback.sh` - Single or full-run rollback

#### Result Handler

Script: `.claude/scripts/flatline-result-handler.sh`

Mode-aware result processing:
- **Autonomous**: HIGH_CONSENSUS auto-integrates, DISPUTED logged, BLOCKER halts
- **Interactive**: All findings presented to user

**Exit Codes**:
| Code | Meaning | Workflow Action |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| 0 | Success | Continue |
| 1 | BLOCKER halt | Generate escalation, HALT |
| 4 | Disputed threshold | Generate escalation, HALT |
| 5 | Integration failed | Log error, continue |

#### Error Handling & Retry

Script: `.claude/scripts/flatline-error-handler.sh`

- Transient vs fatal error categorization
- Exponential backoff with jitter
- Configurable retry limits

**Transient** (retryable): `rate_limit`, `timeout`, `network`, `overloaded`
**Fatal** (no retry): `auth`, `invalid_request`, `budget_exceeded`, `permission_denied`

#### Escalation Reports

Script: `.claude/scripts/flatline-escalation.sh`

Generated on workflow halt:
- Markdown and JSON format
- Includes blockers, disputed items, rollback instructions
- Logged to `grimoires/loa/a2a/flatline/escalation-*.md`

#### `/autonomous` Integration

Flatline reviews integrated into `/autonomous` workflow:
- Phase 1.4: PRD Review (after generation)
- Phase 2.3: SDD Review (after architecture)
- Phase 2.5: Sprint Plan Review (after planning)

```bash
/autonomous --resume  # Continue from Flatline halt
```

#### `/run sprint-plan` Integration

PR template includes Flatline summary:

```markdown
### Flatline Review Summary

| Phase | HIGH | DISPUTED | BLOCKER | Status |
|-------|------|----------|---------|--------|
| PRD   | 5    | 2        | 0       | ✅     |
| SDD   | 3    | 1        | 0       | ✅     |

## [1.21.0] - 2026-02-03 — Flatline Protocol: Multi-Model Adversarial Review

### Why This Release

This release introduces the **Flatline Protocol** - a multi-model adversarial review system using Claude Opus 4.5 + GPT-5.2 for planning document quality assurance. Two frontier models review AND critique each other's suggestions, creating consensus-based quality filtering.

*"When two models agree, you can trust it. When they disagree, you should look closer."*

### Added

#### Flatline Protocol Core (#149)

Multi-model adversarial review with four-phase architecture:

```yaml
# .loa.config.yaml
flatline_protocol:
  enabled: true
  models:
    primary: opus           # Claude Opus 4.5
    secondary: gpt-5.2      # OpenAI GPT-5.2
  thresholds:
    high_consensus: 700     # Both >700 = auto-integrate
    dispute_delta: 300      # Delta >300 = disputed
    low_value: 400          # Both <400 = discard
    blocker: 700            # Skeptic concern >700 = blocker
```

**Protocol Phases**:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Phase 0 | Knowledge retrieval (Tier 1: local + Tier 2: NotebookLM optional) |
| Phase 1 | 4 parallel calls: GPT review, Opus review, GPT skeptic, Opus skeptic |
| Phase 2 | Cross-scoring: GPT scores Opus suggestions, Opus scores GPT suggestions |
| Phase 3 | Consensus extraction: HIGH/DISPUTED/LOW/BLOCKER classification |

**Consensus Thresholds** (0-1000 scale):

| Category | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| `HIGH_CONSENSUS` | Both models >700 | Auto-integrate |
| `DISPUTED` | Score delta >300 | Present to user |
| `LOW_VALUE` | Both models <400 | Discard |
| `BLOCKER` | Skeptic concern >700 | Must address |

#### `/flatline-review` Command

Manual invocation of Flatline Protocol:

```bash
# Review a planning document
/flatline-review grimoires/loa/prd.md

# CLI invocation
.claude/scripts/flatline-orchestrator.sh --doc grimoires/loa/prd.md --phase prd --json
```

#### Auto-Trigger Integration

Planning commands can auto-trigger Flatline review:

```yaml
flatline_protocol:
  auto_trigger:
    enabled: true
    phases: [prd, sdd, sprint]  # /plan-and-analyze, /architect, /sprint-plan
```

When enabled, Flatline review runs automatically after:
- `/plan-and-analyze` → Reviews PRD
- `/architect` → Reviews SDD
- `/sprint-plan` → Reviews Sprint Plan

#### Two-Tier Knowledge Retrieval

**Tier 1 (Local)**: Automatic, always enabled
- `.claude/loa/learnings/` - Framework learnings
- `grimoires/loa/NOTES.md` - Project learnings
- Prior cycle artifacts

**Tier 2 (NotebookLM)**: Optional, requires setup
- Curated domain expertise notebooks
- Browser automation via Patchright
- See: `.claude/skills/flatline-knowledge/resources/auth-setup.md`

```yaml
flatline_protocol:
  knowledge:
    local:
      enabled: true
    notebooklm:
      enabled: false        # Optional
      notebook_id: ""
```

#### Model Adapter

Script: `.claude/scripts/model-adapter.sh`

Unified interface for multi-model calls:
- OpenAI GPT-5.2 via API
- Anthropic Claude Opus via API
- Handles retries, timeouts, error normalization

#### Scoring Engine

Script: `.claude/scripts/scoring-engine.sh`

Cross-model scoring with jq-based aggregation:
- Normalizes scores to 0-1000 scale
- Calculates consensus categories

## [1.20.0] - 2026-02-03 — Input Guardrails & Tool Risk Enforcement

### Why This Release

This release implements **Input Guardrails & Tool Risk Enforcement** based on OpenAI's "A Practical Guide to Building Agents". Provides pre-execution validation for skill invocations with PII filtering, prompt injection detection, and danger level enforcement.

*"Defense in depth for agentic workflows."*

### Added

#### Input Guardrails Framework

Pre-execution validation layer before skill execution:

```yaml
# .loa.config.yaml
guardrails:
  input:
    enabled: true
    pii_filter:
      enabled: true
      mode: blocking
    injection_detection:
      enabled: true
      threshold: 0.7
  danger_level:
    enforce: true
```

**Guardrail Types**:
| Type | Mode | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `pii_filter` | blocking | Redact API keys, emails, SSN, credit cards |
| `injection_detection` | blocking | Detect prompt injection patterns |
| `relevance_check` | advisory | Verify request matches skill purpose |

**Execution Modes**:
- `blocking` - Must pass before skill runs
- `parallel` - Runs async, can trigger tripwire
- `advisory` - Logs warning but continues

#### Danger Level Enforcement

Skills classified by risk level with mode-specific enforcement:

| Level | Interactive | Autonomous |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| `safe` | Execute | Execute |
| `moderate` | Notice | Log |
| `high` | Confirm | BLOCK (use `--allow-high`) |
| `critical` | Confirm+Reason | ALWAYS BLOCK |

**Override for Run Mode**:
```bash
/run sprint-1 --allow-high
/run sprint-plan --allow-high
```

#### PII Filter

Script: `.claude/scripts/pii-filter.sh`

Detects and redacts sensitive patterns:
- API Keys (OpenAI, GitHub, AWS, Anthropic)
- Email addresses, phone numbers
- SSN, credit card numbers
- JWT tokens, private keys
- Home directory paths (anonymization)

#### Injection Detection

Script: `.claude/scripts/injection-detect.sh`

Pattern categories with weighted scoring:
- Instruction override (0.4): "ignore previous", "disregard"
- Role confusion (0.3): "you are now", "act as"
- Context manipulation (0.2): "system prompt", "debug mode"
- Encoding evasion (0.1): base64, unicode tricks

#### Guardrails Orchestrator

Script: `.claude/scripts/guardrails-orchestrator.sh`

Coordinates all checks in sequence:
1. Danger level check
2. PII filter (blocking)
3. Injection detection (blocking)

Returns aggregated PROCEED/WARN/BLOCK action.

#### Tripwire Mechanism

Script: `.claude/scripts/tripwire-handler.sh`

Handles parallel guardrail failures:
- Halt execution on failure
- Optional rollback of uncommitted changes
- Trajectory logging

#### Handoff Logging

Script: `.claude/scripts/log-handoff.sh`

Explicit handoff events in trajectory:
```json
{
  "type": "handoff",
  "from_agent": "implementing-tasks",
  "to_agent": "reviewing-code",
  "artifacts": [{"path": "reviewer.md"}],
  "context_preserved": ["sprint_id"]
}
```

#### Skill Preludes

Input guardrails prelude added to priority skills:
- `implementing-tasks` (moderate danger)
- `deploying-infrastructure` (high danger)
- `autonomous-agent` (high danger)
- `auditing-security` (safe)
- `reviewing-code` (safe)
- `run-mode` (high danger)

### Schemas & Protocols

- **New Protocol**: `.claude/protocols/input-guardrails.md`
- **New Protocol**: `.claude/protocols/danger-level.md`
- **Updated**: `.claude/protocols/feedback-loops.md` (handoff logging)
- **Updated**: `.claude/protocols/run-mode.md` (Level 5 enforcement)
- **Updated**: `skill-index.schema.json` (input_guardrails section)

### Configuration

New config sections in `.loa.config.yaml.example`:
- `guardrails.input` - PII filter, injection detection, relevance check
- `guardrails.tripwire` - Parallel failure handling
- `guardrails.danger_level` - Enforcement rules per mode
- `guardrails.logging` - Trajectory logging options

## [1.19.0] - 2026-02-02 — Invisible Retrospective Learning

### Why This Release

This release brings **Invisible Retrospective Learning**, automatically detecting and cataloging learnings during skill execution without requiring users to invoke `/retrospective` manually. Mirrors the invisible enhancement pattern from PR #145.

*"Learn as you work, silently capturing discoveries for future sessions."*

### Added

#### Invisible Retrospective Learning

Automatic learning detection using skill postludes (mirrors PR #145's prelude pattern):

```yaml
# .loa.config.yaml
invisible_retrospective:
  enabled: true
  surface_threshold: 3  # Min gates to surface (out of 4)
  skills:
    implementing-tasks: true
    auditing-security: true
    reviewing-code: true
```

**Key Features**:
- **Silent Scanning**: Session scanned for learning signals after skill completion
- **4-Gate Quality Filter**: Depth, Reusability, Trigger Clarity, Verification
- **Qualified Surfacing**: Only learnings passing 3+ gates are surfaced to user
- **Trajectory Logging**: All activity logged to `grimoires/loa/a2a/trajectory/retrospective-*.jsonl`
- **NOTES.md Integration**: Qualified learnings added to `## Learnings` section
- **Upstream Queue**: Learnings queued for upstream detection (PR #143 integration)

**Learning Signal Detection**:
| Signal | Example Patterns |
|--------|------------------|
| Error Resolution | "error", "fixed", "resolved", "the issue was" |
| Multiple Attempts | "tried", "finally", "after several" |
| Unexpected Behavior | "surprisingly", "turns out", "discovered" |
| Workaround Found | "instead", "alternative", "the trick is" |
| Pattern Discovery | "pattern", "convention", "always" |

**Skills with Retrospective Postlude**:
- `implementing-tasks` - Bug fixes, debugging discoveries
- `auditing-security` - Security patterns and remediations
- `reviewing-code` - Code review insights

**`/loa` Status Updates**:
- Shows retrospective metrics (detected/extracted/skipped count)
- Last extraction timestamp

#### Schema & Configuration

- New schema: `.claude/schemas/retrospective-log.schema.json`
- New config section: `invisible_retrospective` in `.loa.config.yaml.example`
- Postlude template: `.claude/skills/continuous-learning/resources/retrospective-postlude.md`

### Changed

- `/loa` command now displays invisible retrospective statistics
- Updated CLAUDE.loa.md with Invisible Retrospective documentation

### Technical Notes

- Uses postlude-based architecture (skill SKILL.md files include `<retrospective_postlude>` at END)
- Recursion prevention: continuous-learning skill excluded from postlude execution
- <200ms latency target with early exit for disabled config
- Integrates with PR #143's upstream learning flow via queued learnings

### Related PRs

- PR #145: Invisible Prompt Enhancement (architecture pattern)
- PR #143: Upstream Learning Flow (integration point)

## [1.18.0] - 2026-02-02 — Visual Communication & Invisible Enhancement

### Why This Release

This release brings **Visual Communication v2.0** with GitHub-native Mermaid rendering and browser automation infrastructure, **Invisible Prompt Enhancement** that silently improves prompt quality, and a **95% context reduction** in CLAUDE.md through modular reference files.

*"Better diagrams, better prompts, better context efficiency."*

### Added

#### Visual Communication v2.0 (#144)

Complete rewrite of Mermaid diagram support with multiple rendering modes:

```yaml
# .loa.config.yaml
visual_communication:
  mode: "github"   # github (default) | render | url
  theme: "github"  # github|dracula|nord|tokyo-night|solarized-light|solarized-dark|catppuccin
```

**Key Features**:
- **GitHub Native Mode**: Direct Mermaid code blocks render in GitHub PRs/Issues
- **Local Render Mode**: SVG/PNG output via mermaid-cli for offline use
- **Legacy URL Mode**: External service URLs for backward compatibility
- **7 Theme Presets**: GitHub, Dracula, Nord, Tokyo Night, Solarized (light/dark), Catppuccin

**Browser Automation Infrastructure**:
- MCP dev-browser integration for visual verification
- Screenshot capture to `grimoires/loa/screenshots/`
- Headless and extension modes
- Protocol: `.claude/protocols/browser-automation.md`

#### Invisible Prompt Enhancement (#145)

Automatic prompt enhancement without user visibility using PTCF framework:

```yaml
# .loa.config.yaml
prompt_enhancement:
  invisible_mode:
    enabled: true
    log_to_trajectory: true
```

**Key Features**:
- **Silent Enhancement**: Prompts scoring < 4 are enhanced invisibly
- **PTCF Framework**: Persona + Task + Context + Format analysis
- **Skill-Level Preludes**: Enhancement logic embedded in skill SKILL.md files
- **Recursion Prevention**: `/enhance` command has `enhance: false` frontmatter
- **Trajectory Logging**: Activity logged to `grimoires/loa/a2a/trajectory/prompt-enhancement-*.jsonl`
- **Passthrough on Error**: Any failure uses original prompt unchanged

**Skills with Enhancement Prelude**:
- `discovering-requirements` (/plan-and-analyze)
- `implementing-tasks` (/implement)
- `translating-for-executives` (/translate)

**`/loa` Status Updates**:
- Shows enhancement metrics (enhanced/skipped/errors count)
- Average latency tracking

#### CLAUDE.md Context Optimization (#142)

95% reduction in CLAUDE.md token usage through modular reference architecture:

**New Reference Files** (`.claude/loa/reference/`):
- `context-engineering.md` - Memory protocols, attention budgets
- `protocols-summary.md` - Key protocol summaries
- `scripts-reference.md` - Helper script documentation
- `version-features.md` - Version-specific feature details

**Token Impact**:
- Before: ~50K tokens loaded every session
- After: ~2.5K tokens (table of contents)
- Reference files loaded on-demand

### Changed

- `/loa` command now displays prompt enhancement statistics
- `mermaid-url.sh` enhanced with theme support and local rendering options
- `.loa.config.yaml.example` expanded with visual communication and invisible enhancement configs

### Technical Notes

- Browser automation requires MCP dev-browser server (opt-in)
- Invisible enhancement uses prelude-based architecture (hooks cannot modify prompts)
- Reference files use lazy loading pattern for context efficiency

## [1.17.0] - 2026-02-02 — Upstream Learning Flow

### Why This Release

This release introduces the **Upstream Learning Flow** that enables users to contribute high-value project learnings back to the Loa framework. Eligible learnings are detected silently after retrospectives, anonymized to remove PII, and proposed via GitHub Issues for maintainer review.

*"Knowledge flows upstream. The framework evolves from its users."*

### Added

#### Upstream Learning Flow (#143)

Complete implementation for contributing project learnings to the Loa framework:

```bash
# Propose a specific learning
/propose-learning L-0001

# Preview without submitting
/propose-learning L-0001 --dry-run

# Check proposal status
.claude/scripts/check-proposal-status.sh --learning L-0001
```

**Key Features**:
- **Silent Detection**: Post-retrospective hook identifies eligible learnings automatically
- **User Opt-In**: Presents candidates via AskUserQuestion, never auto-proposes
- **PII Anonymization**: Redacts API keys, paths, emails, IPs, JWT tokens, private keys before submission
- **Weighted Scoring**: `upstream_score = quality(25%) + effectiveness(30%) + novelty(25%) + generality(20%)`
- **Eligibility Threshold**: score ≥ 70, applications ≥ 3, success_rate ≥ 80%
- **Duplicate Detection**: Jaccard similarity check against existing framework learnings
- **Rejection Handling**: 90-day cooldown for rejected proposals

**New Files**:
- `.claude/scripts/upstream-score-calculator.sh` - Weighted eligibility scoring
- `.claude/scripts/anonymize-proposal.sh` - PII redaction (API keys, JWT, private keys, DB creds)
- `.claude/scripts/proposal-generator.sh` - GitHub Issue creation with deduplication
- `.claude/scripts/check-proposal-status.sh` - Proposal status sync from GitHub
- `.claude/scripts/post-retrospective-hook.sh` - Silent detection after /retrospective
- `.claude/commands/propose-learning.md` - User-facing command
- `docs/MAINTAINER_GUIDE.md` - Maintainer workflow for reviewing proposals

**Updated Files**:
- `.claude/schemas/learnings.schema.json` - Added `proposal` object with status, issue_ref, rejection fields
- `.claude/scripts/gh-label-handler.sh` - Added `--body-file` for secure content handling
- `.claude/commands/retrospective.md` - Added Step 6: Upstream Detection
- `.claude/skills/continuous-learning/SKILL.md` - Added Upstream Flow section
- `.loa.config.yaml` - Added `upstream_detection` and `upstream_proposals` config sections

**Historical Learning Extraction**:
- 32 learnings extracted from historical development cycles
- Total framework learnings: 72 (exceeds 50+ PRD target)

**Security Hardening**:
- CRITICAL-001: Command injection prevention via `--body-file` parameter
- HIGH-001: Extended PII patterns (Slack webhooks, JWT, private keys, DB credentials)
- HIGH-002: Null-safe filename iteration with `find -print0`
- Input validation on learning IDs (alphanumeric only)
- Secure temp file handling with `umask 077`

**Configuration** (`.loa.config.yaml`):
```yaml
upstream_detection:
  enabled: true
  min_occurrences: 3
  min_success_rate: 0.8
  min_upstream_score: 70

## [1.16.0] - 2026-02-02 — Managed Scaffolding & Two-Tier Learnings

### Why This Release

This release introduces **Projen-Style Ownership** with managed scaffolding for framework files, and **Two-Tier Learnings Architecture** that ships 40 battle-tested patterns with every Loa installation. Framework files now have clear ownership markers, and learnings flow automatically to every project.

*"Managed files stay managed. Learnings flow downstream. The framework teaches itself."*

### Added

#### Projen-Style Ownership with Managed Scaffolding (#134)

Framework files in `.claude/` now use managed scaffolding inspired by AWS Projen:

```bash
# Check file ownership
.claude/scripts/marker-utils.sh check-marker .claude/protocols/run-mode.md
# → managed: true, version: 1.16.0

# Eject from framework (transfer ownership)
/loa-eject                    # Interactive eject wizard
/loa-eject --file <path>      # Eject specific file
/loa-eject --all              # Full framework eject
```

**Key Features**:
- **`_loa_marker` metadata**: JSON/YAML files include `managed: true`, `version`, `hash` fields
- **`_loa_managed` comments**: Markdown/script files use comment markers
- **Integrity verification**: SHA-256 hash validation for tamper detection
- **Eject command**: Transfer file ownership from framework to project
- **Version-targeted updates**: Update only files from specific versions

**New Files**:
- `.claude/scripts/marker-utils.sh` - Marker verification utilities
- `.claude/scripts/loa-eject.sh` - Eject command implementation
- `.claude/commands/loa-eject.md` - Command routing
- `.claude/skills/loa-eject/` - Eject skill with interactive wizard

**Updated Files**:
- All `.claude/protocols/*.md` - Added `_loa_managed` markers
- All `.claude/schemas/*.json` - Added `_loa_marker` metadata
- All `.claude/scripts/*.sh` - Added `_loa_managed` markers
- `.claude/scripts/update.sh` - Version-targeted update support

#### Two-Tier Learnings Architecture (#139)

Framework learnings now ship with Loa and are available to all projects:

```bash
# Query framework learnings
.claude/scripts/loa-learnings-index.sh query "bash" --tier framework

# Query both tiers (default)
.claude/scripts/loa-learnings-index.sh query "context management"

# Check tier status
.claude/scripts/loa-learnings-index.sh status
# → Framework (Tier 1): 40 (weight: 1.0)
# → Project (Tier 2): 0 (weight: 0.9)
```

**Two-Tier Model**:
| Tier | Location | Weight | Source |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| Framework | `.claude/loa/learnings/` | 1.0 | Ships with Loa |
| Project | `grimoires/loa/a2a/compound/` | 0.9 | Project retrospectives |

**40 Seeded Learnings**:
- **10 Patterns**: Three-Zone Model, JIT Retrieval, Circuit Breaker, etc.
- **8 Anti-Patterns**: Arrow closures, `((var++))` with set -e, etc.
- **10 Decisions**: Why grimoires/, Why draft PRs, Why ICE layer, etc.
- **12 Troubleshooting**: Bash 4+, macOS compatibility, yq vs jq, etc.

**New Files**:
- `.claude/loa/learnings/index.json` - Manifest with counts
- `.claude/loa/learnings/patterns.json` - Proven architectural patterns
- `.claude/loa/learnings/anti-patterns.json` - Common pitfalls
- `.claude/loa/learnings/decisions.json` - Architectural decision records
- `.claude/loa/learnings/troubleshooting.json` - Issue resolution guides

**Updated Files**:
- `.claude/schemas/learnings.schema.json` - Added `tier`, `version_added`, `source_origin`
- `.claude/scripts/loa-learnings-index.sh` - Two-tier indexing with `--tier` flag
- `.claude/scripts/anthropic-oracle.sh` - Weighted search across tiers
- `.claude/scripts/update.sh` - `post_update_learnings()` for sync on update
- `.loa.config.yaml` - `learnings` configuration section

**Closes**: #76 (Extend /oracle to include Loa's own compound learnings)

### Fixed

#### Oracle Bash Increment Exit Code (#138)

Fixed `((count++))` causing premature script termination when `set -e` is active and count starts at 0:

```bash
# Before (fails when count=0)
((count++))

# After (safe increment)
count=$((count + 1))
```

This pattern is now documented in `.claude/loa/learnings/anti-patterns.json`.

### Configuration

New `.loa.config.yaml` sections:

```yaml
# Two-Tier Learnings
learnings:
  tiers:
    framework:
      enabled: true
      weight: 1.0
      source_dir: ".claude/loa/learnings"
    project:
      enabled: true
      weight: 0.9
  query:
    default_tier: all
    max_results: 10
    deduplicate: true
  index:
    rebuild_on_update: true
```

## [1.15.0] - 2026-02-02 — Prompt Enhancement & Developer Experience

### Why This Release

This release introduces the **Intelligent Prompt Enhancement System** with a new `/enhance` command, **consolidated sprint PRs** for cleaner Run Mode output, and several developer experience improvements including the **Canonical URL Registry** to prevent agent hallucination.

*"Enhance your prompts. Consolidate your PRs. Ground your URLs."*

### Added

#### `/enhance` Command & Prompt Enhancement Skill (#108, #109, #120)

New skill and command for improving prompt quality using the PTCF framework (Persona + Task + Context + Format):

```bash
/enhance "review the code"              # Analyze and enhance prompt
/enhance --analyze-only "check auth"    # Analysis without enhancement
/enhance --task-type code_review "..."  # Use specific template
```

**Features**:
- **Quality Scoring**: 0-10 score based on component detection
- **7 Task Templates**: debugging, code_review, refactoring, summarization, research, generation, general
- **Feedback Loop**: Up to 3 refinement iterations based on runtime errors or test failures
- **PTCF Analysis**: Detects missing Persona, Task, Context, and Format components

**New Files**:
- `.claude/skills/enhancing-prompts/` - 3-level skill architecture (15 files, 1282 lines)
- `.claude/commands/enhance.md` - Command routing

**Sources**: [Google Gemini Prompting Guide](https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/gemini-gems-ai-guide-prompting), SDPO feedback concepts

#### Canonical URL Registry (#127, #131)

Protocol and infrastructure to prevent agent URL hallucination:

```yaml
# grimoires/loa/urls.yaml (auto-created during /mount)
project:
  repository: "https://github.com/org/repo"
  documentation: "https://docs.example.com"
anthropic:
  docs: "https://docs.anthropic.com"
  api_reference: "https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api"
```

**Agent Protocol**: Agents must use `urls.yaml` entries or explicit user-provided URLs. Never fabricate URLs.

**New Files**:
- `.claude/protocols/url-registry.md` - Protocol specification
- `grimoires/loa/urls.yaml` - Created during `/mount`

#### Consolidated Sprint PRs (#124, #132)

`/run sprint-plan` now creates a **single consolidated PR** after all sprints complete (default behavior):

```bash
/run sprint-plan                  # Consolidated PR at end (default)
/run sprint-plan --no-consolidate # Legacy: separate PR per sprint
```

**Benefits**:
- Single PR for easier review
- Per-sprint breakdown table in PR description
- Commits grouped by sprint (`feat(sprint-1): ...`)
- Clean git history with sprint markers

**Updated Files**:
- `.claude/protocols/run-mode.md` - Consolidated PR format
- `.claude/skills/run-mode/SKILL.md` - Updated execution loop
- `.claude/commands/run-sprint-plan.md` - New `--no-consolidate` option

### Fixed

#### Mount Version Detection (#123, #133)

Fixed `/mount` installing outdated version (v1.7.2) instead of latest:

- `sync_zones()` now pulls upstream `.loa-version.json` during installation
- `create_manifest()` reads from pulled file with git tag fallback
- Removed hardcoded version from banner

#### Oracle Auto-Index (#116, #128)

Fixed `/oracle-analyze` returning no results when index doesn't exist:

- Oracle now auto-builds index on first query
- Clear error messages when index build fails

#### Feedback Trace Enablement (#115, #125, #130)

`/feedback` now prompts to enable trace collection when disabled:

- AskUserQuestion offers "Enable for this submission" option
- One-time collection without persisting settings
- Created `feedback` label in all ecosystem repos (#126)

#### Constructs API Migration (#106, #107)

Fixed `/constructs` command after API endpoint changes:

- Updated to unified `/v1/constructs` endpoint
- Supports both `.data[]` and legacy `.packs[]` response formats

### Documentation

#### Memory Leak Pattern (#129)

Added arrow function closure memory leak pattern to review and audit skills:

- `.claude/skills/reviewing-code/resources/REFERENCE.md` - Detection criteria
- `.claude/skills/auditing-security/resources/REFERENCE.md` - CWE-401 classification
- `grimoires/loa/memory/learnings.yaml` - Learning entry L-0001

**Pattern**: Use `obj.method.bind(obj)` instead of `() => obj.method()` to prevent closure memory leaks (1GB+ reduction in long sessions).

#### README Version Badge (#122)

Synced README version badge to current release.

---

## [1.14.1] - 2026-02-01 — Constructs Bug Fix

### Fixed

#### get_api_key() Missing from Shared Library (#104, #105)

Fixed undefined function error in `/constructs` command. The `get_api_key()` and `check_file_permissions()` functions were only defined in `constructs-install.sh` but called by `constructs-auth.sh` and `constructs-browse.sh`.

**Solution**: Moved both functions to `constructs-lib.sh` (the shared library sourced by all constructs scripts).

---

## [1.14.0] - 2026-02-01 — Constructs Multi-Select UI

### Why This Release

The `/constructs` command brings a streamlined pack installation experience with multi-select UI. Browse the Loa Constructs Registry, select multiple packs, and install them in one flow.

*"Point. Click. Install. The registry at your fingertips."*

### Added

#### `/constructs` Command (#88)

New slash command for browsing and installing packs from the Loa Constructs Registry:

```bash
/constructs              # Browse with multi-select UI
/constructs install <pack>   # Direct install
/constructs list         # Show installed packs
/constructs update       # Check for updates
/constructs uninstall <pack> # Remove a pack
/constructs auth         # Check auth status
/constructs auth setup   # Configure API key
```

**Multi-Select UI**: Uses Claude Code's `AskUserQuestion` with `multiSelect: true` for intuitive pack selection:

```
Select packs to install:

  [x] 🔮 Observer (6 skills) - User truth capture
  [x] ⚗️ Crucible (5 skills) - Validation & testing
  [ ] 🎨 Artisan (10 skills) - Brand/UI craftsmanship
  [ ] 📣 GTM Collective (Pro) - Go-to-market skills 🔒

  [Install Selected]  [Skip for Now]
```

**New Files**:
- `.claude/commands/constructs.md` - Command definition with agent routing
- `.claude/skills/browsing-constructs/` - Multi-select workflow skill
- `.claude/scripts/constructs-browse.sh` - Registry API + caching (1hr TTL)
- `.claude/scripts/constructs-auth.sh` - API key setup and validation

**Authentication**: Premium packs require API key:
```bash
/constructs auth setup   # Interactive setup
# Or set environment variable
export LOA_CONSTRUCTS_API_KEY="sk_your_key"
```

### Documentation

- **README.md** - Added `/constructs` to Ad-hoc commands
- **INSTALLATION.md** - New "Browse and Install with `/constructs`" section

## [1.12.0] - 2026-02-01 — Oracle Compound Learnings

### Why This Release

Loa now **learns from itself**. The Oracle system has been extended to query Loa's own compound learnings alongside Anthropic documentation. This implements the recursive improvement loop: Executions → Feedback → Oracle → Skills → Executions.

*"Loa should be its own oracle—teaching other agent systems how to improve based on what worked here."*

### Added

#### Oracle Compound Learnings (#89, #76)

Extend the oracle system to query Loa's own accumulated knowledge with hierarchical source weighting.

- **`query` Command** - New oracle action with scope parameter:
  ```bash
  # Query Loa learnings only
  .claude/scripts/anthropic-oracle.sh query "auth token" --scope loa

  # Query Anthropic docs only
  .claude/scripts/anthropic-oracle.sh query "hooks" --scope anthropic

  # Query all sources with weighted ranking
  .claude/scripts/anthropic-oracle.sh query "patterns" --scope all
  ```

- **Hierarchical Source Weighting**:
  | Source | Weight | Description |

#### WIP Branch Testing (#91, #93)

Test Loa framework updates on feature branches before merging to your working branch.

- **Branch Mode Selection** - When `/update-loa` detects a feature branch:
  - Option 1: "Checkout for testing (Recommended)" - Creates `test/loa-*` branch
  - Option 2: "Merge into current branch" - Existing behavior

- **`branch-state.sh`** - State management for test branches
  - Saves original branch for return flow
  - Commands: `save`, `load`, `clear`, `is-testing`
  - State file: `.loa/branch-testing.json`

- **Return Helper** - When on `test/loa-*` branch:
  - Return to original branch
  - Stay on test branch
  - Merge test branch into original

- **Configurable Patterns** - Feature branch detection:
  ```yaml
  update_loa:
    branch_testing:
      enabled: true
      feature_patterns: ["feature/*", "fix/*", "topic/*", "wip/*", "test/*"]
      test_branch_prefix: "test/loa-"
  ```

  - Prompts user: Archive (Y), Keep (n), or Abort (q)
  - Archives to cycle's archive directory with timestamp
  - Prevents stale context from polluting new development cycles

- **One-Time Hooks** - `once: true` flag prevents duplicate runs per session
  - Update check only runs once on session start

- **Session ID Tracking** - `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` now logged in trajectory files
  - Enables cross-session correlation and debugging

- **Skill Forking Protocol** - Documentation for `context: fork` pattern
  - Read-only skills like `/ride` use isolated execution context

---

## [1.8.0] - 2026-01-28 — Memory Stack

### Why This Release

This release introduces the **Memory Stack** - a vector database with PreToolUse hook system for mid-stream semantic grounding during Claude Code sessions. All security vulnerabilities identified in the comprehensive audit have been remediated.

*"Learnings that persist. Context that recalls itself."*

### Added

## [1.7.2] - 2026-01-28 — Issues Remediation

### Fixed

- **Mount Script Version Detection** (#56) - Fixed hardcoded fallback version `0.6.0` → `1.7.1`
  - Version detection now checks root `.loa-version.json` first
  - Updated banner version from `v0.9.0` to `v1.7.1`

- **Anthropic Oracle URLs** (#58) - Updated Claude Code documentation URLs
  - Docs moved from `docs.anthropic.com` to `code.claude.com`
  - Added new endpoints: `memory`, `skills`, `hooks`

### Added

- **Sprint Auto-Continuation** (#55) - `/run sprint-plan` now automatically continues to next sprint
  - Sprint plan execution loop with automatic advancement
  - State tracking in `sprint-plan-state.json`
  - Sprint discovery priority: `sprint.md` → `ledger.json` → `a2a/` directories

- **Sprint Ledger Auto-Creation** (#57) - `/sprint-plan` now offers to create ledger if missing
  - Step 0 checks for ledger existence before planning
  - User prompt via `AskUserQuestion` with option to decline
  - Follows existing ledger.json schema

---

## [1.7.1] - 2026-01-24 — Template Cleanup

### Fixed

- **Template Pollution** - Removed 9 Loa-specific PRD/SDD/sprint documents that were accidentally committed in v1.6.0 and v1.7.0:
  - `prd-ck-migration.md`, `sdd-ck-migration.md`, `sprint-ck-migration.md`
  - `prd-ride-before-plan.md`, `sdd-ride-before-plan.md`, `sprint-ride-before-plan.md`
  - `prd-goal-traceability.md`, `sdd-goal-traceability.md`, `sprint-goal-traceability.md`

- **Improved .gitignore** - Updated patterns from exact filenames (`prd.md`) to globs (`prd*.md`) to prevent future pollution from feature-variant documents

### Notes

Fresh installs of v1.6.0 or v1.7.0 would have included these development documents in the `grimoires/loa/` directory. Users can safely delete them - they are Loa framework development artifacts, not project templates.

---

## [1.7.0] - 2026-01-24 — Goal Traceability & Guided Workflow

### Why This Release

This release introduces **Goal Traceability** - the ability to verify that PRD goals are actually achieved through sprint implementation. No more "we completed all tasks but did we hit the goals?" uncertainty.

*"Goals without traceability are wishes. Goals with traceability are commitments."*

### Added

- **Goal Validator Subagent** (`.claude/subagents/goal-validator.md`)
  - Verifies PRD goals are achieved through implementation
  - Three verdict levels: `GOAL_ACHIEVED`, `GOAL_AT_RISK`, `GOAL_BLOCKED`
  - Integration gap detection (new data without consumers, new APIs without callers)
  - Automatic invocation during final sprint review
  - Manual invocation via `/validate goals`

- **Goal Traceability Matrix** (Sprint Plan Appendix C)
  - Maps PRD goals to contributing tasks
  - Identifies E2E validation tasks per goal
  - Auto-generated by `/sprint-plan`

- **Workflow State Detection** (`workflow-state.sh`)
  - Detects current workflow state (initial → prd_created → sdd_created → sprint_planned → implementing → reviewing → auditing → complete)
  - Suggests next command based on state
  - Progress percentage tracking
  - Semantic cache integration (RLM pattern)

- **`/loa` Command** - Guided workflow entry point
  - Shows current state and progress
  - Suggests appropriate next action
  - No more guessing "what command should I run?"

- **Goal Status Section** in NOTES.md template
  - Track goal achievement: `NOT_STARTED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `AT_RISK`, `ACHIEVED`, `BLOCKED`
  - Lightweight evidence identifiers (JIT pattern)
  - Validation cache key tracking

### Changed

- **Workflow Chain** updated to require goal traceability steps
- **NOTES.md Template** updated with Goal Status section using JIT retrieval pattern
- **Goal Validator** follows Loa patterns:
  - JIT Retrieval: Lightweight identifiers instead of eager loading
  - Semantic Cache: Results cached via `cache-manager.sh`
  - Beads Integration: Validation findings tracked with `br` commands
  - Truth Hierarchy: CODE → BEADS → NOTES → TRAJECTORY → PRD

### Configuration

```yaml
# .loa.config.yaml
goal_validation:
  enabled: true              # Master toggle (opt-in by default)
  block_on_at_risk: false    # Default: warn only
  block_on_blocked: true     # Default: always block
  require_e2e_task: true     # Require E2E task in final sprint
```

### Backward Compatibility

- If PRD has no goal IDs: auto-assigns G-1, G-2, G-3
- If sprint has no Appendix C: warns but doesn't block
- If `goal_validation.enabled: false`: skips entirely
- Existing projects continue working unchanged

---

## [1.6.0] - 2026-01-23 — Codebase Grounding & Security Hardening

### Why This Release

This release combines **Cycle-008** (ck-First Semantic Search Migration) and **Cycle-009** (Security Remediation v2). The `/plan-and-analyze` command now automatically grounds itself in codebase reality for brownfield projects, and all 30 security findings from the comprehensive audit have been addressed.

*"CODE IS TRUTH. PRDs are now grounded in what actually exists, not what we think exists."*

### Added

- **Automatic Codebase Grounding** (`/plan-and-analyze`)
  - Phase -0.5 automatically runs `/ride` for brownfield projects
  - Greenfield projects skip to Phase -1 with zero latency
  - Uses cached reality if <7 days old (configurable)
  - `--fresh` flag forces re-analysis
  - Configuration in `.loa.config.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    plan_and_analyze:
      codebase_grounding:
        enabled: true
        reality_staleness_days: 7
        ride_timeout_minutes: 20
        skip_on_ride_error: false
    ```

- **Brownfield Detection** (`detect-codebase.sh`)
  - Detects >10 source files OR >500 lines of code
  - Identifies primary language and source paths
  - 41 comprehensive BATS unit tests
  - JSON output for programmatic consumption

- **ck-First Semantic Search** (`search-orchestrator.sh`)
  - `ck` as primary search with automatic grep fallback
  - Updated for ck v0.7.0+ CLI syntax (`--sem`, `--limit`, positional path)
  - Three search modes: `semantic`, `hybrid`, `regex`
  - Input validation: regex syntax, numeric params, path traversal protection

- **Skills Updated for ck Search**
  - `riding-codebase`: Route, model, env var, tech debt extraction
  - `reviewing-code`: Impact analysis with hybrid search
  - `implementing-tasks`: Context retrieval with hybrid search
  - `deploying-infrastructure`: Secrets scanning with regex search
  - `translating-for-executives`: Ghost feature examples

### Security

- **CRITICAL Fixes (2)**
  - CRIT-001: Fixed Python code injection in `constructs-install.sh` heredoc
    - Uses quoted `'PYEOF'` delimiter + environment variables
  - CRIT-002: Added path traversal protection in pack extraction
    - New `safe_path_join()` with realpath + component validation

- **HIGH Fixes (8)**
  - HIGH-001: Atomic ledger writes with flock (5s timeout)
  - HIGH-002: Process substitution for Authorization header (no ps exposure)

## [1.5.0] - 2026-01-23 — Recursive JIT Context System

### Why This Release

Introduces the **Recursive JIT Context System** — a comprehensive solution for context management in long-running agent sessions. This release addresses the fundamental challenge of Claude Code's automatic context summarization by providing semantic caching, intelligent condensation, and continuous synthesis to persistent ledgers.

*"The code remembers what the context forgets."*

### Added

- **Recursive JIT Context System** (`.claude/scripts/`)
  - `cache-manager.sh` — Semantic result caching with mtime-based invalidation
    - LRU eviction, TTL expiration (30 days default)
    - Secret pattern detection on write
    - Integrity verification with SHA256 hashes
  - `condense.sh` — Result condensation engine
    - Strategies: `structured_verdict` (~50 tokens), `identifiers_only` (~20), `summary` (~100)
    - Full result externalization to `.claude/cache/full/`
  - `early-exit.sh` — Parallel subagent coordination
    - File-based "first-to-finish wins" protocol
    - Session management, agent registration, result passing
  - `synthesize-to-ledger.sh` — Continuous synthesis trigger
    - Writes decisions to NOTES.md and trajectory at RLM trigger points
    - Survives Claude Code's automatic context summarization

- **Continuous Synthesis** — Anti-platform-summarization defense
  - RLM operations (cache set, condense, early-exit) trigger automatic ledger writes
  - Decisions externalized to NOTES.md Decision Log
  - Trajectory entries for audit trail
  - Optional bead comment injection (when `br` available)
  - Configuration in `.loa.config.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    recursive_jit:
      continuous_synthesis:
        enabled: true
        on_cache_set: true
        on_condense: true
        on_early_exit: true
        update_bead: true
    ```

- **Post-Upgrade Health Check** (`upgrade-health-check.sh`)
  - Detects bd → br migration status
  - Finds deprecated references in settings.local.json
  - Identifies new config sections available
  - Suggests recommended permissions for new features
  - Auto-fix mode: `--fix` flag applies safe corrections
  - Runs automatically after `update.sh`

- **Upgrade Completion Banner** (`upgrade-banner.sh`)
  - Cyberpunk-themed ASCII art completion message
  - Rotating quotes from Neuromancer, Blade Runner, The Matrix, Ghost in the Shell
  - Original Loa-themed quotes about synthesis and context management
  - CHANGELOG highlights parsing (when available)

  - JSON output for scripting: `--json`

- **beads_rust Integration** with Continuous Synthesis
  - Active bead detection from NOTES.md Session Continuity
  - Automatic `[Synthesis] <message>` comment injection
  - Redundant persistence: NOTES.md + trajectory + bead comments

- **Protocol Documentation**
  - `.claude/protocols/recursive-context.md` — Full RLM system documentation
  - Architecture diagrams, integration patterns, configuration reference

### Changed

- **Opt-Out Defaults** — All RLM features now enabled by default
  - Scripts use `// true` fallbacks instead of `// false`
  - Users can disable features in config rather than needing to enable them
  - Ships with sane defaults for immediate benefit

- **CLAUDE.md** — Updated with Recursive JIT Context section
  - New scripts documented in Helper Scripts table
  - Protocol references added

### Technical Details

- **Two-Level Context Management**
  - Platform level: Claude Code's automatic summarization (outside Loa's control)
  - Framework level: Loa's protocols for proactive externalization (full control)
  - Solution: Write to ledgers BEFORE platform summarization occurs

- **Performance Targets**
  - Cache hit rate: >30% over 30 days
  - Context reduction: 30-40% via condensation
  - Cache lookup: <100ms
  - Condensation: <50ms

### Migration Notes

No migration required. All features are enabled by default and backward compatible.

  ```yaml
  upgrade:
    auto_commit: true   # Create git commit after upgrade
    auto_tag: true      # Create version tag
    commit_prefix: "chore"  # Conventional commit prefix
  ```

- **`--no-commit` Flag**: Skip automatic commit creation
  - `mount-loa.sh --no-commit`
  - `update.sh --no-commit`

- **Protocol Documentation**
  - `.claude/protocols/helper-scripts.md` - Comprehensive script documentation
  - `.claude/protocols/upgrade-process.md` - 12-stage upgrade workflow documentation

### Changed

- **CLAUDE.md**: Reduced from 1,157 lines to 321 lines (72% reduction)
  - Core instructions remain in CLAUDE.md
  - Detailed documentation moved to protocol files
  - References added for JIT loading when needed

### Technical Details

- **Stealth Mode**: No commits created in stealth persistence mode
- **Tag Handling**: Existing tags are not overwritten
- **Dirty Tree**: Warnings shown but upgrades continue
- **Config Priority**: CLI flags > config file > defaults

### Migration Notes

No migration required. Existing installations will gain clean upgrade behavior automatically on next update.

### Developer Experience

- **Simplified installation** - `cargo install beads_rust` or download binary
- **No virtualenv management** - Eliminates `bd` activation dance
- **Consistent behavior** - Same binary across all platforms

### Technical Debt Reduction

- **Removes Python dependency** - Framework is now pure shell + Rust
- **Eliminates daemon startup issues** - Rust daemon is more stable
- **Cleaner error messages** - Rust's error handling is more precise

### Changed

- **All beads scripts migrated** to use `br` CLI instead of `bd`
  - `check-beads.sh` - Updated detection and installation
  - `create-sprint-epic.sh` - Uses `br create`
  - `create-sprint-task.sh` - New script for task creation

  - PROCESS.md - Updated workflow references

### Security Hardening

Comprehensive security audit identified and remediated 16 vulnerabilities:

| Severity | Fixed | Key Fixes |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| CRITICAL | 3 | Shell injection prevention, credential permissions, log sanitization |
| HIGH | 8 | Path traversal, jq/yq injection, symlink attacks, content verification |
| MEDIUM | 4 | Temp file cleanup, input validation library |
| LOW | 1 | Rate limiting infrastructure |

**Security Grade**: B+ → **A-** (Production-ready)

#### Security Functions Added

- `secure_credentials_file()` - Enforces 600/400 file permissions
- `sanitize_sensitive_data()` - Redacts credentials from permission logs
- `validate_path_safe()` - Prevents path traversal attacks
- `validate_identifier()` - Sanitizes yq/jq arguments
- `safe_symlink()` - Validates symlink targets before creation

- `validate_api_key()`, `validate_url()`, `validate_safe_identifier()` - Input validation library
- `check_rate_limit()`, `reset_rate_limit()` - Rate limiting infrastructure

### Migration Guide

**For existing projects using `bd`:**

1. Install beads_rust: `cargo install beads_rust`
2. The `br` CLI is API-compatible with `bd` for common operations
3. Existing `.beads/` directory and data are compatible
4. Run `br doctor` to verify installation

**Command mapping:**
| Old (`bd`) | New (`br`) |
|------------|------------|
| `bd create` | `br create` |
| `bd list` | `br list` |
| `bd sync` | `br sync` |
| `bd prime` | `br prime` |

### Breaking Changes

- **`bd` CLI no longer supported** - Framework now requires `br` (beads_rust)
- Old beads scripts removed: `install-beads.sh`, `get-ready-by-priority.sh`, `sync-to-git.sh`
- `beads-workflow.md` protocol replaced by `beads-integration.md`

---

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-19

### Fixed

- **Template Pollution**: `grimoires/loa/ledger.json` was being tracked in git and shipped with the template, causing new projects mounted with Loa to inherit development cycle history from the Loa framework itself.

### Changed

- Added `grimoires/loa/ledger.json` and `grimoires/loa/ledger.json.bak` to `.gitignore`
- Removed existing `ledger.json` from git tracking

### Remediation

If you mounted Loa v1.0.0 and see "active cycle Documentation Coherence" or similar inherited state:

```bash
# Option 1: Delete the inherited ledger and start fresh
rm grimoires/loa/ledger.json
/plan-and-analyze

# Option 2: Pull the fix via update
/update-loa
```

New projects mounted from v1.0.1+ will start with a clean slate.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-19 — Run Mode AI (Autonomous Initiation)

### Why This Release

This is **Loa's first major release** — a milestone that marks the framework's evolution from experimental agent orchestration to production-ready autonomous development. **Run Mode AI** ("AI" = Autonomous Initiation) represents the culmination of 19 iterative releases, 6 development cycles, and comprehensive battle-testing across real-world projects.

Loa 1.0.0 delivers:

1. **Autonomous Sprint Execution**: `/run sprint-N` executes complete implement → review → audit cycles without human intervention
2. **Multi-Sprint Orchestration**: `/run sprint-plan` executes entire sprint plans, creating a single draft PR
3. **4-Level Safety Defense**: ICE Layer, Circuit Breaker, Opt-In, and Visibility controls prevent runaway execution
4. **Continuous Learning**: Agents extract non-obvious discoveries into reusable skills
5. **Intelligent Subagents**: Specialized validation (architecture, security, tests) with automated quality gates
6. **Documentation Coherence**: Every task ships with its documentation — no batching at sprint end

## [0.15.0] - 2026-01-18

### Why This Release

This release delivers two major feature cycles:

1. **Sprint Ledger** (Cycle 1): Global sprint numbering across multiple development cycles, preventing directory collisions when running `/plan-and-analyze` multiple times.

2. **RLM Context Improvements** (Cycle 2): Probe-before-load pattern achieving 29.3% token reduction, based on MIT CSAIL research on Recursive Language Models.

Additionally, this release removes the `/setup` phase, allowing users to start immediately with `/plan-and-analyze`.

### Added

### Previous 0.15.0 Changes (Setup Removal)

This release also removes the `/setup` phase entirely, allowing users to start with `/plan-and-analyze` immediately after cloning. THJ membership is now detected via the `LOA_CONSTRUCTS_API_KEY` environment variable instead of a marker file.

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **`/setup` command removed**: No longer needed. Start directly with `/plan-and-analyze`
- **`/mcp-config` command removed**: MCP configuration is now documentation-only
- **`.loa-setup-complete` no longer created**: THJ detection uses API key presence
- **Phase 0 removed from workflow**: Workflow now starts at Phase 1

### Added

- **`is_thj_member()` function** (`.claude/scripts/constructs-lib.sh`)
  - Canonical source for THJ membership detection
  - Returns 0 when `LOA_CONSTRUCTS_API_KEY` is set and non-empty
  - Zero network dependency - environment variable check only

- **`check-thj-member.sh` script** (`.claude/scripts/check-thj-member.sh`)
  - Pre-flight check script for THJ-only commands
  - Used by `/feedback` to gate access

### Removed

- **`/setup` command** (`.claude/commands/setup.md`)
- **`/mcp-config` command** (`.claude/commands/mcp-config.md`)
- **`check_setup_complete()` function** (from `preflight.sh`)
- **`check_cached_detection()` function** (from `git-safety.sh`)
- **`is_detection_disabled()` function** (from `git-safety.sh`)

### Changed

- **All phase commands**: Removed `.loa-setup-complete` pre-flight check
  - `/plan-and-analyze` - No prerequisites, this is now the entry point
  - `/architect` - Only requires PRD
  - `/sprint-plan` - Only requires PRD and SDD
  - `/implement` - Only requires PRD, SDD, and sprint.md
  - `/review-sprint` - Unchanged (requires reviewer.md)
  - `/audit-sprint` - Unchanged (requires "All good" approval)
  - `/deploy-production` - Only requires PRD and SDD

- **`/feedback` command**: Uses script-based THJ detection
  - Now uses `check-thj-member.sh` pre-flight script
  - Error message directs OSS users to GitHub Issues
  - THJ members need `LOA_CONSTRUCTS_API_KEY` set

- **`analytics.sh`**: Updated to use `is_thj_member()` from constructs-lib.sh
  - `get_user_type()` returns "thj" or "oss" based on API key presence
  - `should_track_analytics()` delegates to `is_thj_member()`

- **`preflight.sh`**: Updated THJ detection
  - `check_user_is_thj()` now uses `is_thj_member()`
  - Sources `constructs-lib.sh` for canonical detection function

- **`git-safety.sh`**: Removed marker file detection layer
  - Template detection now uses origin URL, upstream remote, and GitHub API only
  - Removed cached detection that read from marker file

- **`check-prerequisites.sh`**: Removed marker file checks
  - All phases work without `.loa-setup-complete`
  - `setup` case removed entirely
  - `plan|prd` case now has no prerequisites

- **`.gitignore`**: Updated comment for `.loa-setup-complete`
  - Marked as legacy (v0.14.0 and earlier)
  - Entry remains for backward compatibility

### Documentation

- **README.md**: Updated Quick Start to remove `/setup` step
- **CLAUDE.md**: Removed Phase 0 from workflow table, added THJ detection note
- **PROCESS.md**: Updated overview to reflect seven-phase workflow

### Migration Guide

**For existing projects:**
- The `.loa-setup-complete` file is no longer needed
- THJ members should set `LOA_CONSTRUCTS_API_KEY` environment variable
- Existing marker files are safely ignored (not deleted)

**For new projects:**
- Clone and immediately run `/plan-and-analyze`
- THJ members: Set `LOA_CONSTRUCTS_API_KEY` for constructs access and `/feedback`
- OSS users: Full workflow access, submit feedback via GitHub Issues

## [0.12.0] - 2026-01-12

### Why This Release

This release introduces the **Grimoires Restructure** - a reorganization of the grimoire directory structure for better separation of private project state and public shareable content. The new `grimoires/` directory serves as the home for all grimoires, with `grimoires/loa/` for private state and `grimoires/pub/` for public documents.

### Added

- **Grimoires Directory Structure**
  | Path | Git Status | Purpose |
  |------|------------|---------|
  | `grimoires/loa/` | Ignored | Private project state (PRD, SDD, notes, trajectories) |
  | `grimoires/pub/` | Tracked | Public documents (research, audits, shareable artifacts) |

- **Migration Tool** (`.claude/scripts/migrate-grimoires.sh`)
  ```bash
  migrate-grimoires.sh check      # Check if migration needed
  migrate-grimoires.sh plan       # Preview changes (dry-run)
  migrate-grimoires.sh run        # Execute migration
  migrate-grimoires.sh rollback   # Revert using backup
  migrate-grimoires.sh status     # Show current state
  ```
  - Backup-before-migrate pattern for safety
  - JSON output support for automation (`--json`)
  - Force mode for scripted usage (`--force`)

- **Public Grimoire Structure** (`grimoires/pub/`)
  ```
  grimoires/pub/
  ├── research/     # Research and analysis documents
  ├── docs/         # Shareable documentation
  ├── artifacts/    # Public build artifacts
  └── audits/       # Security audit reports
  ```

- **CI Template Protection**: Extended to protect `grimoires/pub/` from project-specific content in template repository

### Changed

- **Path Migration**: 134+ files updated from `loa-grimoire` to `grimoires/loa`
  - All scripts in `.claude/scripts/`
  - All skills in `.claude/skills/`
  - All commands in `.claude/commands/`
  - All protocols in `.claude/protocols/`
  - Configuration files (`.gitignore`, `.loa-version.json`, `.loa.config.yaml`)
  - Documentation (README.md, CLAUDE.md, INSTALLATION.md, PROCESS.md)

- **Update Script**: Now checks for grimoire migration after framework updates (Stage 11)

### Security

- Migration tool security audit: **APPROVED**
  - No command injection vulnerabilities (all paths hardcoded)
  - Safe shell scripting (`set -euo pipefail`)
  - Proper backup/rollback capability
  - Audit report: `grimoires/pub/audits/grimoires-restructure-audit.md`

### Migration Guide

Existing projects using `loa-grimoire/` will be prompted to migrate:

```bash
# Check if migration needed
.claude/scripts/migrate-grimoires.sh check

# Preview changes
.claude/scripts/migrate-grimoires.sh plan

# Execute migration (creates backup automatically)
.claude/scripts/migrate-grimoires.sh run

# If issues occur, rollback
.claude/scripts/migrate-grimoires.sh rollback
```

The migration tool will:
1. Create `grimoires/` directory structure
2. Move content from `loa-grimoire/` to `grimoires/loa/`
3. Update `.loa.config.yaml` and `.gitignore` references
4. Create `grimoires/pub/` with README files

### Breaking Changes

**None** - The migration tool provides a smooth upgrade path. Existing `loa-grimoire/` paths continue to work until manually migrated.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-01-04

### Why This Release

This release adds the **Loa Constructs CLI** - a command-line interface for installing packs and skills from the Loa Constructs Registry. Pack commands are now automatically symlinked to `.claude/commands/` after installation, making them immediately available.

### Added

- **`constructs-install.sh`** - New CLI for pack and skill installation
  ```bash
  constructs-install.sh pack <slug>              # Install pack from registry
  constructs-install.sh skill <vendor/slug>      # Install individual skill
  constructs-install.sh uninstall pack <slug>    # Remove a pack
  constructs-install.sh uninstall skill <slug>   # Remove a skill
  constructs-install.sh link-commands <slug|all> # Re-link pack commands
  ```

- **Automatic Command Symlinking** (Fixes #21)
  - Pack commands in `.claude/constructs/packs/{slug}/commands/` are automatically symlinked to `.claude/commands/`
  - User files are never overwritten (safety feature)
  - Existing pack symlinks are updated on reinstall

- **Skill Symlinking for Loader Discovery**
  - Pack skills symlinked to `.claude/constructs/skills/{pack}/` for loader compatibility

- **Comprehensive Test Suite**
  - 21 unit tests covering installation, symlinking, uninstall, and edge cases

### Fixed

- **#20**: Add CLI install command for Loa Constructs packs
- **#21**: Pack commands not automatically available after installation

### Directory Structure Update

```
.claude/constructs/packs/{slug}/
├── commands/           # Pack commands (auto-symlinked to .claude/commands/)
├── skills/             # Pack skills (auto-symlinked to .claude/constructs/skills/)
├── manifest.json       # Pack metadata
└── .license.json       # JWT license token
```

## [0.10.0] - 2026-01-03

### Why This Release

This release introduces **Loa Constructs** - a commercial skill distribution system that enables third-party skills and skill packs to be installed, validated, and loaded alongside local skills. Skills are JWT-signed with RS256, license-validated with grace periods, and support offline operation.

### Added

- **Loa Constructs Registry Integration**
  - Commercial skill distribution via `loa-constructs-api.fly.dev`
  - JWT-signed licenses with RS256 signature verification
  - Grace periods by tier: 24h (individual/pro), 72h (team), 168h (enterprise)
  - Offline operation with cached public keys
  - Skill packs for bundled skill distribution

- **New Scripts** (`.claude/scripts/`)
  | Script | Purpose |
  |--------|---------|
  | `constructs-loader.sh` | Main CLI for listing, validating, loading constructs |
  | `constructs-lib.sh` | Shared library functions for construct operations |
  | `license-validator.sh` | JWT license validation with RS256 signatures |

- **New Protocol** (`.claude/protocols/constructs-integration.md`)
  - Skill loading priority (local > override > registry > pack)
  - License validation flow with exit codes
  - Offline behavior and key caching
  - Directory structure for installed constructs

- **Auto-Gitignore for Constructs**
  - `.claude/constructs/` automatically added to `.gitignore` on install
  - Prevents accidental commit of licensed content
  - `ensure-gitignore` CLI command for manual verification

- **CI Template Protection**
  - `.claude/constructs/` added to forbidden paths in CI
  - Prevents licensed skills from being committed to template repository

- **Comprehensive Test Suite** (2700+ lines)
  - Unit tests for loader, lib, and license validator
  - Integration tests with mock API server
  - E2E tests for full workflow validation
  - Pack support and update check tests

### Changed

- **Configuration**: New `.loa.config.yaml` options

    default_url: "https://loa-constructs-api.fly.dev/v1"
    validate_licenses: true
    offline_grace_hours: 24
    check_updates_on_setup: true
  ```

- **CLAUDE.md**: Added Registry Integration section with API endpoints, authentication, and CLI commands

### Directory Structure

```
.claude/constructs/
├── skills/{vendor}/{slug}/    # Installed skills
│   ├── .license.json          # JWT license token
│   ├── index.yaml             # Skill metadata
│   └── SKILL.md               # Instructions

│   └── skills/                # Bundled skills
└── .constructs-meta.json      # Installation state
```

### Breaking Changes

**None** - This release is fully backward compatible. The constructs system is opt-in and does not affect existing local skills.

## [0.9.2] - 2025-12-31

### Why This Release

The `/update` command was overwriting project-specific `CHANGELOG.md` and `README.md` files with Loa framework template versions. These files define the project, not the framework, and should always be preserved during updates.

### Fixed

- **`/update` Command**: Now preserves project identity files during framework updates
  - Added `CHANGELOG.md` and `README.md` to the Merge Strategy table as preserved files
  - Added "Project Identity Files" section in Conflict Resolution guidance
  - These files are now automatically resolved with `--ours` (keep project version)
  - Updated Next Steps to link to upstream releases instead of local CHANGELOG

### Upgrade Instructions

No action required. The fix is in the `/update` command documentation itself, so future updates will properly preserve your project files.

If you previously lost your `CHANGELOG.md` or `README.md` during an update:
```bash
git checkout <commit-before-update> -- CHANGELOG.md README.md
git commit -m "fix: restore project CHANGELOG and README"
```

---

## [0.9.1] - 2025-12-30

### Why This Release

**CRITICAL UPGRADE**: Version 0.9.0 was released with project-specific artifacts (PRD, SDD, sprint plans, A2A files) that should never have been in the template. This polluted the template and caused new installations to include irrelevant documentation.

This release cleans up the template and adds strict CI guards to prevent this from happening again.

### Fixed

- **Template Pollution**: Removed all project-specific files from `loa-grimoire/`
  - Deleted: `prd.md`, `sdd.md`, `sprint.md`, `NOTES.md`
  - Deleted: All `a2a/sprint-*` directories and files
  - Deleted: `deployment/`, `reality/`, `analytics/`, `research/` contents
  - Each directory now contains only a README.md explaining its purpose

### Added

- **Template Protection CI Guard**: New GitHub Actions job that blocks forbidden files
  - Runs first, all other CI jobs depend on it passing
  - Blocks: `prd.md`, `sdd.md`, `sprint.md`, `NOTES.md`, `a2a/*`, `deployment/*`, `reality/*`, `analytics/*`, `research/*`
  - Escape hatch: `[skip-template-guard]` in commit message for exceptional cases
  - `.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md` documents required GitHub settings

- **Branch Protection**: GitHub API configured to enforce strict checks
  - `Template Protection` status check required
  - `Validate Framework Files` status check required
  - Admin bypass disabled (`enforce_admins: true`)

### Changed

- **`.gitignore`**: Now excludes all template-specific files by default
  - README.md files in each directory are preserved
  - Projects using Loa as a base will automatically ignore generated artifacts

### Upgrade Instructions

**If you installed v0.9.0**, you have polluted template files. To clean up:

```bash
# Pull the clean template
/update

# Or manually remove polluted files
rm -rf loa-grimoire/prd.md loa-grimoire/sdd.md loa-grimoire/sprint.md
rm -rf loa-grimoire/NOTES.md loa-grimoire/a2a/* loa-grimoire/deployment/*
rm -rf loa-grimoire/reality/* loa-grimoire/analytics/* loa-grimoire/research/*
```

**New installations** from v0.9.1+ will start clean automatically.

## [0.9.0] - 2025-12-27

### Why This Release

This release introduces the **Lossless Ledger Protocol** - a paradigm shift from "compact to survive" to "clear, don't compact." Instead of letting Claude's context compaction smudge your reasoning state, agents now proactively checkpoint their work to persistent ledgers before clearing context, enabling instant lossless recovery.

### Added

- **Lossless Ledger Protocol**: "Clear, Don't Compact" context management
  - Proactive `/clear` before compaction instead of reactive summarization
  - Tiered state recovery: Level 1 (~100 tokens), Level 2 (~500 tokens), Level 3 (full)
  - Session continuity across context clears with zero information loss
  - Grounding ratio enforcement (≥0.95 required before `/clear`)

  - Lightweight identifier format for 97% token reduction

- **Grounding Enforcement Protocol** (`.claude/protocols/grounding-enforcement.md`)
  - 4 grounding types: `citation`, `code_reference`, `user_input`, `assumption`
  - Configurable enforcement levels: `strict` (blocking), `warn` (advisory), `disabled`
  - Script: `.claude/scripts/grounding-check.sh` - Calculates grounding ratio
  - Default threshold: 0.95 (95% of claims must be grounded)

- **Synthesis Checkpoint Protocol** (`.claude/protocols/synthesis-checkpoint.md`)
  - 7-step checkpoint before `/clear`: 2 blocking, 5 non-blocking
  - Step 1: Grounding verification (blocking if strict)
  - Step 2: Negative grounding ghost detection (blocking)
  - Steps 3-7: Decision sync, Bead update, handoff log, decay advisory, EDD verify
  - Script: `.claude/scripts/synthesis-checkpoint.sh`

- **Attention Budget Protocol** (`.claude/protocols/attention-budget.md`)
  - Traffic light system: Green (0-5k), Yellow (5-15k), Red (>15k tokens)
  - Delta-synthesis at Yellow threshold
  - Advisory-only (doesn't block)

- **JIT Retrieval Protocol** (`.claude/protocols/jit-retrieval.md`)
  - Lightweight identifiers: `${PROJECT_ROOT}/path:lines | purpose | timestamp`
  - 97% token reduction vs embedding full code blocks
  - `ck` semantic search integration with grep fallback

- **Self-Healing State Zone**
  - Script: `.claude/scripts/self-heal-state.sh`
  - Recovery priority: git history → git checkout → template
  - Automatic recovery of NOTES.md, trajectory/, .beads/

- **UAT Validation Script** (`.claude/scripts/validate-prd-requirements.sh`)
  - Validates all 11 Functional Requirements (FR-1 through FR-11)
  - Validates 2 Integration Requirements (IR-1, IR-2)
  - 45 automated checks with pass/fail/warning output

- **CI/CD Validation** (`.claude/scripts/check-loa.sh` enhanced)
  - `check_v090_protocols()` - Validates 5 protocol files
  - `check_v090_scripts()` - Validates 3 scripts (executable, shellcheck)
  - `check_v090_config()` - Validates grounding configuration
  - `check_notes_template()` - Validates NOTES.md sections

### Changed

- **NOTES.md Schema Extended**: New required sections
  - `## Session Continuity` - Critical context (~100 tokens)
  - `## Lightweight Identifiers` - Code references table
  - `## Decision Log` - Timestamped decisions with grounding

- **Trajectory Logging Enhanced**: New entry types
  - `session_handoff` - Context passed to next session
  - `negative_grounding` - Ghost feature detection
  - `test_scenario` - EDD verification entries

- **Configuration**: New `.loa.config.yaml` options
  ```yaml
  grounding:
    enforcement: warn    # strict | warn | disabled
    threshold: 0.95      # 0.00-1.00
  ```

## [0.4.0] - 2025-12-21

### Why This Release

This release delivers a major architectural refactor based on Anthropic's recommendations for Claude Code skills development. The focus is on action-oriented naming, modular architecture, and extracting deterministic logic to reusable scripts—making skills more maintainable and reducing context overhead.

### Added

- **v4 Command Architecture**: Thin routing layer with YAML frontmatter
  - `agent:` and `agent_path:` fields for skill routing
  - `command_type:` for special commands (wizard, survey, git)
  - `pre_flight:` validation checks before execution
  - `context_files:` with prioritized loading and variable substitution

- **3-Level Skills Architecture**: Modular structure for all 8 agents
  - Level 1: `index.yaml` - Metadata and triggers (~100 tokens)
  - Level 2: `SKILL.md` - KERNEL instructions (<500 lines)
  - Level 3: `resources/` - Templates, scripts, references (loaded on-demand)

- **Context-First Discovery**: `/plan-and-analyze` now ingests existing documentation
  - Auto-scans `loa-grimoire/context/` for `.md` files before interviewing
  - Presents understanding with source citations before asking questions
  - Only asks about gaps, ambiguities, and strategic decisions
  - Parallel ingestion for large context (>2000 lines)
  - New script: `.claude/scripts/assess-discovery-context.sh`

- **8 New Helper Scripts** (`.claude/scripts/`)
  | Script | Purpose |
  |--------|---------|
  | `check-feedback-status.sh` | Sprint feedback state detection |
  | `validate-sprint-id.sh` | Sprint ID format validation |
  | `check-prerequisites.sh` | Phase prerequisite checking |
  | `assess-discovery-context.sh` | Context size assessment |
  | `context-check.sh` | Parallel execution thresholds |
  | `preflight.sh` | Pre-flight validation functions |
  | `analytics.sh` | Analytics helpers (THJ only) |
  | `git-safety.sh` | Template detection utilities |

- **Protocol Documentation** (`.claude/protocols/`)
  - `git-safety.md` - Template detection, warning flow, remediation
  - `analytics.md` - THJ-only tracking, schema definitions
  - `feedback-loops.md` - A2A communication, approval markers

- **Context Directory** (`loa-grimoire/context/`)
  - New location for pre-discovery documentation
  - Template README with suggested file structure
  - Supports nested directories and any `.md` files

### Changed

- **Skill Naming Convention**: All 8 skills renamed from role-based to action-based (gerund form)
  | Old Name | New Name |
  |----------|----------|
  | `prd-architect` | `discovering-requirements` |
  | `architecture-designer` | `designing-architecture` |
  | `sprint-planner` | `planning-sprints` |
  | `sprint-task-implementer` | `implementing-tasks` |
  | `senior-tech-lead-reviewer` | `reviewing-code` |
  | `paranoid-auditor` | `auditing-security` |
  | `devops-crypto-architect` | `deploying-infrastructure` |
  | `devrel-translator` | `translating-for-executives` |

- **Documentation Streamlining**: Reduced CLAUDE.md from ~1700 to ~200 lines
  - Detailed specifications moved to `.claude/protocols/`
  - Single source of truth principle enforced
  - Command tables reference skill files for details

- **discovering-requirements Skill**: Complete rewrite for context-first workflow
  - Phase -1: Context Assessment (runs script)
  - Phase 0: Context Synthesis with XML context map
  - Phase 0.5: Targeted Interview for gaps only
  - Phases 1-7: Conditional based on context coverage
  - Full source tracing in PRD output

- **Parallel Execution Thresholds**: Standardized across skills
  | Skill | SMALL | MEDIUM | LARGE |
  |-------|-------|--------|-------|
  | discovering-requirements | <500 | 500-2000 | >2000 |
  | reviewing-code | <3,000 | 3,000-6,000 | >6,000 |
  | auditing-security | <2,000 | 2,000-5,000 | >5,000 |
  | implementing-tasks | <3,000 | 3,000-8,000 | >8,000 |
  | deploying-infrastructure | <2,000 | 2,000-5,000 | >5,000 |

### Breaking Changes

- **Skill Names Renamed**: All 8 skills have new names (see Changed section)
  - Custom commands referencing old names will need updates
  - Automation scripts using skill names must be migrated
  - Migration script available: `.claude/scripts/migrate-skill-names.sh`

### Migration Guide

If you have custom commands or scripts referencing old skill names:

```bash
# Run the migration script on your custom files
./.claude/scripts/migrate-skill-names.sh --check  # Preview changes
./.claude/scripts/migrate-skill-names.sh          # Apply changes
```

Or manually update references using this mapping:
- `prd-architect` → `discovering-requirements`
- `architecture-designer` → `designing-architecture`
- `sprint-planner` → `planning-sprints`
- `sprint-task-implementer` → `implementing-tasks`
- `senior-tech-lead-reviewer` → `reviewing-code`
- `paranoid-auditor` → `auditing-security`
- `devops-crypto-architect` → `deploying-infrastructure`
- `devrel-translator` → `translating-for-executives`

### Technical Details

- **Command Files Updated**: 10 commands with new skill references
- **Agent Files Renamed**: 8 agent files to match new naming
- **Index Files Updated**: 8 index.yaml files with gerund names
- **GitHub Templates Updated**: Issue templates reference new names
- All references to old skill names migrated throughout codebase

## [0.3.0] - 2025-12-20

### Why This Release

Claude Code has a tendency to proactively suggest git operations—committing changes, creating PRs, and pushing to remotes—which can be problematic when working in forked repositories. Developers using Loa as a template for their own projects were at risk of accidentally pushing proprietary code to the public upstream repository (`0xHoneyJar/loa`).

This release introduces comprehensive safety rails to prevent these accidents while still enabling intentional contributions back to the framework.

### Added
- **Git Safety Protocol**: Multi-layer protection against accidental pushes to upstream template repository
  - 4-layer template detection system (origin URL, upstream remote, loa remote, GitHub API)
  - Automatic detection during `/setup` with results stored in marker file
  - Warnings before push/PR operations targeting upstream
  - Prevents accidentally leaking project-specific code to the public Loa repository

- **`/contribute` command**: Guided OSS contribution workflow for contributing back to Loa
  - Pre-flight checks (feature branch, clean working tree, upstream remote)
  - Standards checklist (clean commits, no secrets, tests, DCO)
  - Automated secrets scanning with common patterns (API keys, tokens, credentials)
  - DCO sign-off verification with fix guidance
  - Guided PR creation with proper formatting
  - Handles both fork-based and direct repository contributions

- **Template detection in `/setup`**: New Phase 0.5 detects fork/template relationships
  - Runs before user-type selection
  - Displays safety notice when template detected
  - Stores detection metadata in `.loa-setup-complete` marker file

- **`/config` command**: Post-setup MCP server reconfiguration (THJ only)
  - Allows adding/removing MCP integrations after initial setup
  - Shows currently configured servers
  - Updates marker file with new configuration

### Changed
- **Setup marker file schema**: Now includes `template_source` object with detection metadata
  ```json
  {
    "template_source": {
      "detected": true,
      "repo": "0xHoneyJar/loa",
      "detection_method": "origin_url",
      "detected_at": "2025-12-20T10:00:00Z"
    }
  }
  ```
- **CLAUDE.md**: Added Git Safety Protocol documentation and `/contribute` command reference
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Updated with contribution workflow using `/contribute` command
- **Documentation**: Updated setup flow diagrams and command reference tables

### Security
- **Secrets scanning**: `/contribute` scans for common secret patterns before PR creation
  - AWS access keys (AKIA...)
  - GitHub tokens (ghp_...)
  - Slack tokens (xox...)
  - Private keys (-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----)
  - Generic password/secret/api_key patterns
- **DCO enforcement**: Contribution workflow verifies Developer Certificate of Origin sign-off
- **Template isolation**: Prevents accidental code leakage from forked projects to upstream

  - Non-blocking: failures logged but don't interrupt workflows
  - Opt-in sharing: only sent via `/feedback` command

### Changed
- **Fresh template**: Removed all generated loa-grimoire content (PRD, SDD, sprint plans, A2A files) so new projects start clean
- All phase commands now update analytics on completion
- `/plan-and-analyze` blocks if setup marker is missing
- `/deploy-production` suggests running `/feedback` after deployment
